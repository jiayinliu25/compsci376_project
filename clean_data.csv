Bob Dylan,4Th Time Around,"When she said, ""Don't waste your words, they're just lies,""  
I cried she was deaf.  
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes,  
Then said, ""What else you got left?""  
It was then that I got up to leave  
But she said, ""Don't forget,  
Everybody must give something back  
For something they get.""  
  
I stood there and hummed,  
I tapped on her drum  
And asked her how come.  
And she buttoned her boot,  
And straightened her suit,  
Then she said, ""Don't get cute.""  
So I forced my hands in my pockets  
And felt with my thumbs,  
And gallantly handed her  
My very last piece of gum.  
  
She threw me outside,  
I stood in the dirt where ev'ryone walked.  
And after finding I'd forgotten my shirt,  
I went back and knocked.  
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it,  
And I tried to make sense  
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair  
That leaned up against--  
  
Her Jamaican rum  
And when she did come, I asked her for some.  
She said, ""No, dear.""  
I said, ""Your words aren't clear,  
You'd better spit out your gum.""  
She screamed till her face got so red,  
Then she fell on the floor,  
And I covered her up and then  
Thought I'd go look through her drawer.  
  
And when I was through  
I filled up my shoe and brought it to you.  
And you, you took me in,  
You loved me then, you never wasted time.  
And I, I never took much,  
I never asked for your crutch  
And I don't ask for mine.

Bob Dylan,A Satisfied Mind,"How many times have you heard someone say  
If I had his money I'd do things my way  
Hmm, but little they know  
Hmm, it's so hard to find  
One man in ten with a satisfied mind.  
  
Hmm, once I was wading in fortune and fame  
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in lifes game  
But suddenly it happened  
Hmm, I lost every dime  
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind.  
  
Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out  
My friends and my loved ones I'll leave there ain't no doubt  
But one things for certain  
When it comes my time  
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind.

Bob Dylan,All Over You,"By Bob Dylan  
  
Well, if I had to do it all over again,  
Babe, I'd do it all over you.  
And if I had to wait for ten thousand years,  
Babe, I'd even do that too.  
Well, a dog's got his bone in the alley,  
A cat, she's got nine lives,  
A millionaire's got a million dollars,  
King Saud's got four hundred wives.  
Well, ev'rybody's got somethin'  
That they're lookin' forward to.  
I'm lookin' forward to when I can do it all again  
And babe, I'll do it all over you.  
  
Well, if I had my way tomorrow or today,  
Babe, I'd run circles all around.  
I'd jump up in the wind, do a somersault and spin,  
I'd even dance a jig on the ground.  
Well, everybody gets their hour,  
Everybody gets their time,  
Little David when he picked up his pebbles,  
Even Sampson after he went blind.  
Well, everybody gets the chance  
To do what they want to do.  
When my time arrives you better run for your life  
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you.  
  
Well, I don't need no money, I just need a day that's sunny,  
Baby, and my days are gonna come.  
And I grab me a pint, you know that I'm a giant  
When you hear me yellin', ""Fee-fi-fo-fum.""  
Well, you cut me like a jigsaw puzzle,  
You made me to a walkin' wreck,  
Then you pushed my heart through my backbone,  
Then you knocked off my head from my neck.  
Well, if I'm ever standin' steady  
A-doin' what I want to do,  
Well, I tell you little lover that you better run for cover  
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you.  
  
I'm just restin' at your gate so that I won't be late  
And, momma, I'm a-just sittin' on the shelf.  
Look out your window fair and you'll see me squattin' there  
Just a-fumblin' and a-mumblin' to myself.  
Well, after my cigarette's been smoked up,  
After all my liquor's been drunk,  
After my dreams are dreamed out,  
After all my thoughts have been thunk,  
Well, after I do some of these things,  
I'm gonna do what I have to do.  
And I tell you on the side, that you better run and hide  
'Cause babe, I'll do it all over you.

Bob Dylan,Ballad Of Donald White,"My name is Donald White, you see,  
I stand before you all.  
I was judged by you a murderer  
And the hangman's knot must fall.  
I will die upon the gallows pole  
When the moon is shining clear,  
And these are my final words  
That you will ever hear.  
  
I left my home in Kansas  
When I was very young,  
I landed in the old Northwest,  
Seattle, Washington  
Although I'd a-traveled many miles,  
I never made a friend,  
For I could never get along in life  
With people that I met.  
  
If I had some education  
To give me a decent start,  
I might have been a doctor or  
A master in the arts.  
But I used my hands for stealing  
When I was very young,  
And they locked me down in jailhouse cells,  
That's how my life begun.  
  
Oh, the inmates and the prisoners,  
I found they were my kind,  
And it was there inside the bars  
I found my peace of mind.  
But the jails they were too crowded,  
Institutions overflowed,  
So they turned me loose to walk upon  
Life's hurried tangled road.  
  
And there's danger on the ocean  
Where the salt sea waves split high,  
And there's danger on the battlefield  
Where the shells of bullets fly,  
And there's danger in this open world  
Where men strive to be free,  
And for me the greatest danger  
Was in society.  
  
So I asked them to send me back  
To the institution home.  
But they said they were too crowded,  
For me they had no room.  
I got down on my knees and begged,  
""Oh, please put me away,""  
But they would not listen to my plea  
Or nothing I would say.  
  
And so it was on Christmas eve  
In the year of '59,  
It was on that night I killed a man,  
I did not try to hide,  
The jury found me guilty  
And I won't disagree,  
For I knew that it would happen  
If I wasn't put away.  
  
And I'm glad I've had no parents  
To care for me or cry,  
For now they will never know  
The horrible death I die.  
And I'm also glad I've had no friends  
To see me in disgrace,  
For they'll never see that hangman's hood  
Wrap around my face.  
  
Farewell unto the old north woods  
Of which I used to roam,  
Farewell unto the crowded bars  
Of which've been my home,  
Farewell to all you people  
Who think the worst of me,  
I guess you'll feel much better when  
I'm on that hanging tree.  
  
But there's just one question  
Before they kill me dead,  
I'm wondering just how much  
To you I really said  
Concerning all the boys that come  
Down a road like me,  
Are they enemies or victims  
Of your society?

Bob Dylan,Belle Isle,"One evening for pleasure I rambled to view  
The fair fields all alone  
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron  
Where beauty and pleasure were known.  
  
I spied a fair maid at her labour  
Which caused me to stay for a while  
And I thought of a goddess to beauty  
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle.  
  
I humbled myself to her beauty  
""Fair maiden, where do you belong ?  
Are you from heaven descended  
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne ?"".  
  
""Young man, I will tell you a secret  
It's true I'm a maid that is poor  
And to part from my vows and my promise  
Is more than my heart can endure.  
  
Therefore I remain at my service  
And go through all my hardship and toil  
And wait for the lad that has left me  
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle"".  
  
""Young maiden I wish not to banter  
It's true I come here in disguise  
I came here to fulfill our last promise  
And hope to give you a surprise.  
  
I've known you're a maid I love dearly  
And you've been in my heart all the while  
For me there is no other damsel  
Than my bloomin' bright star of Belle Isle"".

I've known you're a maid I love dearly  
And you've been in my heart all the while  
For me there is no other damsel  
Than my bloomin' bright star of Belle Isle""."
Bob Dylan,Beyond Here Lies Nothin',"Oh well, I love you pretty baby  
You're the only love I've ever known  
Just as long as you stay with me  
The whole world is my throne  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing we can call our own  
  
Well, I'm moving after midnight  
Down boulevards of broken cars  
Don't know what I do without it  
Without this love that we call ours  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing but the moon and stars  
  
Down every street there's a window  
And every window made of glass  
We'll keep on loving pretty baby  
For as long as love will last  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
But the mountains of the past  
  
Well my ship is in the harbor  
And the sails are spread  
Listen to me, pretty baby  
Lay your hand upon my head  
Beyond here lies nothin'  
Nothing done and nothing said

Bob Dylan,Beyond The Horizon,"Beyond the horizon, behind the sun  
At the end of the rainbow life has only begun  
In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above  
Beyond the horizon it is easy to love  
  
My wretched heart's pounding  
I felt an angel's kiss  
My memories are drowning  
In mortal bliss  
  
Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall  
Love waits forever for one and for all  
  
Beyond the horizon across the divide  
'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side  
Down in the valley the water runs cold  
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul  
  
I'm touched with desire  
What don't I do?  
I'll throw the logs on the fire  
I'll build my world around you  
  
Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game  
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same  
  
Beyond the horizon the night winds blow  
The theme of a melody from many moons ago  
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime  
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time  
  
It's dark and it's dreary  
I ponder in vain  
I'm weakened, I'm weary  
My repentance is plain  
  
Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea  
I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me  
  
Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies  
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes  
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone  
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone  
  
It's late in the season  
Never knew, never cared  
Whatever the reason  
Someone's life has been spared  
  
Beyond the horizon the sky is so blue  
I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you

Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan's Dream,"While riding on a train goin' west,  
I fell asleep for to take my rest.  
I dreamed a dream that made me sad,  
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had.  
  
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room  
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon,  
Where we together weathered many a storm,  
Laughin' and singin' till the early hours of the morn.  
  
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung,  
Our words were told, our songs were sung,  
Where we longed for nothin' and were quite satisfied  
Talkin' and a-jokin' about the world outside.  
  
With haunted hearts through the heat and cold,  
We never thought we could ever get old.  
We thought we could sit forever in fun  
But our chances really was a million to one.  
  
As easy it was to tell black from white,  
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right.  
And our choices were few and the thought never hit  
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split.  
  
How many a year has passed and gone,  
And many a gamble has been lost and won,  
And many a road taken by many a friend,  
And each one I've never seen again.  
  
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain,  
That we could sit simply in that room again.  
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat,  
I'd give it all gladly if our lives could be like that.

Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan's New Orleans Rag,"By Bob Dylan  
  
I was sittin' on a stump  
Down in New Orleans,  
I was feelin' kinda low down,  
Dirty and mean.  
Along came a fella  
And he didn't even ask.  
He says, ""I know of a woman  
That can fix you up fast. ""  
I didn't think twice,  
I said like I should,  
""Let's go find this lady  
That can do me some good. ""  
We walked across the river  
On a sailin' spree  
And we came to a door  
Called one-oh-three.  
  
I was just about ready  
To give it a little knock  
When out comes a fella  
Who couldn't even walk.  
He's linkin' and a-slinkin',  
Couldn't stand on his feet,  
And he moaned and he groaned  
And he shuffled down the street.  
Well, out of the door  
There comes another man.  
He wiggled and he wobbled,  
He couldn't hardly stand.  
He had this frightened  
Look in his eyes,  
Like he just fought a bear,  
He was ready to die.  
  
Well, I peeked through the key crack,  
Comin' down the hall  
Was a long-legged man  
Who couldn't hardly crawl.  
He muttered and he uttered  
In broken French,  
And he looked like he'd been through  
A monkey wrench.  
  
Well, by this time  
I was a-scared to knock,  
I was a-scared to move,  
I's in a state of shock.  
I hummed a little tune  
And I shuffled my feet  
And I started walkin' backwards  
Down that broad street.  
Well, I got to the corner,  
I tried my best to smile.  
I turned around the corner  
And I ran a bloody mile.  
Man, I wasn't runnin'  
'Cause I was sick,  
I was just a-runnin'  
To get out of there quick.  
  
Well, I tripped right along  
And I'm a-wheezin' in my chest.  
I musta run a mile  
In a minute or less.  
I walked on a log  
And I tripped on a stump,  
I caught a fast freight  
With a one-arm jump.  
So, if you're travelin' down  
Louisiana way,  
And you feel kinda lonesome  
And you need a place to stay,  
Man, you're better off  
In your misery  
Than to tackle that lady  
At one-oh-three.

Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell,  
If you're a real hot momma, come take away Daddy's weeping spell."
Bob Dylan,California,"By Bob Dylan  
  
I'm goin' down south,  
'Neath the borderline.  
I'm goin' down south,  
'Neath the borderline.  
Some fat momma  
Kissed my mouth one time.  
  
Well, I needed it this morning  
Without a shadow of doubt.  
My suitcase is packed,  
My clothes are hangin' out.  
  
San Francisco's fine,  
You sure get lots of sun.  
San Francisco is fine.  
You sure get lots of sun.  
But I'm used to four seasons,  
California's got but one.  
  
Well, I got my dark sunglasses,  
I got for good luck my black tooth.  
I got my dark sunglasses,  
And for good luck I got my black tooth.  
Don't ask me nothin' about nothin',  
I just might tell you the truth.

Bob Dylan,Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?,"He sits in your room, his tomb with a fist full of tacks  
Preoccupied with his vengeance  
Cursin' the dead that can't answer him back  
You know he has no intentions  
Of looking your way, unless it's to say  
That he needs you to test his inventions.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
  
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels  
Trying to peel the moon and expose it  
With his business-like anger and bloodhounds that kneel  
If he needs a third eye he just grows it  
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk  
Or pick it up after he throws it.  
  
Please crawl out your window  
Use your arms and legs it won't ruin you  
How can you say he will haunt you  
You can go back to him any time you want to.  
  
He looks so righteous while your face is so changed  
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in  
While his genocide fools and friends rearrange  
Their religion of the little ten women  
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised  
Come on out the dark is beginning.

Bob Dylan,Can't Help Falling In Love,"Wise men say only fools rush in  
But I can't help falling in love with you.  
Shall I stay, will it be a sin  
If I can't help falling in love with you?  
  
Like a river flows surely to the sea  
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be.  
Take my hand, take my whole life too  
For I can't help falling in love with you.

Bob Dylan,Catfish,"Lazy stadium night  
Catfish on the mound.  
""Strike three,"" the umpire said,  
Batter have to go back and sit down.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Used to work on Mr. Finley's farm  
But the old man wouldn't pay  
So he packed his glove and took his arm  
An' one day he just ran away.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Come up where the Yankees are,  
Dress up in a pinstripe suit,  
Smoke a custom-made cigar,  
Wear an alligator boot.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Carolina born and bred,  
Love to hunt the little quail.  
Got a hundred-acre spread,  
Got some huntin' dogs for sale.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Reggie Jackson at the plate  
Seein' nothin' but the curve,  
Swing too early or too late  
Got to eat what Catfish serve.  
  
Catfish, million-dollar-man,  
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can.  
  
Even Billy Martin grins  
When the Fish is in the game.  
Every season twenty wins  
Gonna make the Hall of Fame.

Bob Dylan,Chimes Of Freedom,"Far between sundown's finish an' midnight's broken toll  
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing  
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds  
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing  
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight  
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight  
An' for each an' ev'ry underdog soldier in the night  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
In the city's melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched  
With faces hidden while the walls were tightening  
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin' rain  
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning  
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake  
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned an' forsakened  
Tolling for the outcast, burnin' constantly at stake  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail  
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder  
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze  
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder  
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind  
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind  
An' the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales  
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position  
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts  
All down in taken-for-granted situations  
Tolling for the deaf an' blind, tolling for the mute  
Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute  
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased an' cheated by pursuit  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Even though a cloud's white curtain in a far-off corner flashed  
An' the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting  
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones  
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting  
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail  
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale  
An' for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.  
  
Starry-eyed an' laughing as I recall when we were caught  
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended  
As we listened one last time an' we watched with one last look  
Spellbound an' swallowed 'til the tolling ended  
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed  
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones an' worse  
An' for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe  
An' we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing.

They took a clean-cut kid

They said, ""Listen boy, you're just a pup""

They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills  
A jeep to drive, blood to spill.  
  
They said, ""Congratulation, you got what it takes""  
They sent him back into the race without any brakes.  
  
They took a clean-cut kid  
And they made a killer out of him  
That's what they did.  
  
He bought the American Dream but put it in doubt

Bob Dylan,Clothes Line,"After a while we took in the clothes,  
Nobody said very much.  
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants  
Which nobody really wanted to touch.  
Mama come in and picked up a book  
An' Papa asked her what it was.  
Someone else asked, ""What do you care?""  
Papa said, ""Well, just because.""  
Then they started to take back their clothes,  
Hang 'em on the line.  
It was January the thirtieth  
And everybody was feelin' fine.  
  
The next day everybody got up  
Seein' if the clothes were dry.  
The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed,  
Mama, of course, she said, ""Hi!""  
""Have you heard the news?"" he said, with a grin,  
""The Vice-President's gone mad!""  
""Where?"" ""Downtown."" ""When?"" ""Last night.""  
""Hmm, say, that's too bad!""  
""Well, there's nothin' we can do about it,"" said the neighbor,  
""It's just somethin' we're gonna have to forget.""  
""Yes, I guess so,"" said Ma,  
Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet.  
  
I reached up, touched my shirt,  
And the neighbor said, ""Are those clothes yours?""  
I said, ""Some of 'em, not all of 'em.""  
He said, ""Ya always help out around here with the chores?""  
I said, ""Sometime, not all the time.""  
Then my neighbor, he blew his nose  
Just as papa yelled outside,  
""Mama wants you t' come back in the house and bring them clothes.""  
Well, I just do what I'm told,  
So, I did it, of course.  
I went back in the house and Mama met me

Bob Dylan,Copper Kettle,"Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil  
Fill it with new made corn mash and never more you'll toil  
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright  
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.  
  
Build you a fire with hickory, hickory, ash and oak  
Don't use no green or rotten wood, they'll get you by the smoke  
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright  
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.  
  
My daddy he made whiskey, my granddaddy he did too  
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792  
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright  
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight.

Love that country pie.  
  
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon and lime  
What do I care?  
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin and plum  
Call me for dinner,  
Honey, I'll be there.  
  
Saddle me up on my big white goose  
Tie me on 'er turn her loose  
Oh me, oh my  
Love that country pie.  
  
I don't need much and that ain't no lie  
Ain't runnin' any race  
Give to me my country pie  
I won't throw it up in anybody's face.  
  
Shake me up that old peach tree  
Little Jack Horner's got nothin' on me  
Oh me, oh my  
Love that country pie."
Bob Dylan,Cry A While,"Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith  
A nasty, dirty, double-crossin', back-stabbin' phony I didn't want to have to
be dealin' with  
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn to cry awhile  
  
I don't carry dead weight - I'm no flash in the pan  
All right, I'll set you straight, can't you see I'm a union man?  
I'm lettin' the cat out of the cage, I'm keeping a low profile  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Feel like a fighting rooster - feel better than I ever felt  
But the Pennsylvania line's in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to
melt  
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Last night 'cross the alley there was a pounding on the walls  
It must have been Don Pasquale makin' a two a.m. booty call  
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn to cry awhile  
  
I'm on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can't control  
Some people they ain't human, they got no heart or soul  
Well, I'm crying to The Lord - I'm tryin' to be meek and mild  
Yes, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Well, there's preachers in the pulpits and babies in the cribs  
I'm longin' for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs  
I'm gonna buy me a barrel of whiskey - I'll die before I turn senile  
Well, I cried for you - now it's your turn, you can cry awhile  
  
Well, you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way  
I always said you'd be sorry and today could be the day  
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial  
Well, I cried for you, now it's your turn, you can cry awhile

Bob Dylan,Dark Eyes,"Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside  
They're drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide  
I live in another world where life and death are memorized  
Where the earth is strung with lover's pearls and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
A cock is crowing far away and another soldier's deep in prayer  
Some mother's child has gone astray, she can't find him anywhere  
But I hear another rum beating for the dead that rise  
Whom nature's beast fear as they come and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes  
They tell me revenge is sweet, I'm sure it is  
But I feel nothing for their game, where beauty goes unrecognized  
All I feel is heat and flame, and all I see are dark eyes.  
  
Oh, the French girl, she's in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel  
Hunger pays a heavy prize to the falling god of speed and steel  
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that
flies  
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes.

And if you don't underestimate me,  
I won't underestimate you.

Whole lot of people struggling tonight from the disease of conceit  
Comes right down the highway straight down the line  
Rips into your senses through your body and your mind  
Nothing about it that's sweet  
The disease of conceit.  
  
There's a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of hearts shaking tonight from the disease of conceit  
Steps into your eats into your soul  
Over your senses you have no control  
Ain't nothing too discreet about the disease of conceit.  
  
There's a whole lot of people dying tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people crying tonight from the disease of conceit  
Comes right out of nowhere and you're down for the count  
From the outside world the pressure will mount  
Turn you into a piece of meat  
The disease of conceit.  
  
Conceit is the disease that the doctors got no cure  
They've done a lot of research on it but what it is they're still not sure.  
  
There's a whole lot of people in trouble tonight from the disease of conceit  
Whole lot of people seeing trouble tonight fro the disease of conceit  
Give you delusions of grandeur an evil eye  
Give you the idea that you're too good to die  
The they bury you from head to feet  
From the disease of conceit.

Just a minute before you touch the door  
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?  
Do you think we can talk about it some more?  
You know the streets are filled with vipers  
Who've lost all ray of hope  
You know, it ain't even safe no more  
In the palace of the Pope.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
Come over here from over there, girl  
Sit down here, you can have my chair  
I can't see us going anywhere, girl  
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there

Maybe I'd have saved some life that had been lost  
Maybe I'd have done some good in the world  
'Stead of burning every bridge I crossed.

So you might not know exactly how I feel  
But if I could, I'd bring you to the mountaintop, girl  
And build you a house made out of stainless steel  
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting  
My throat start to tickle and my nose itches  
But I know that I can't move.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's gone but the past lives on  
Tomorrow's just one step beyond  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
Who are these people who are walking towards you  
Do you know them or will there be a fight?  
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through  
Can they tell you what's wrong from right?  
  
Do you remember St. James Street  
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?  
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet  
And laid his life on the line.  
  
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl  
No more booby traps and bombs  
No more decadence and charm  
No more affection that's been misplaced, girl  
No more mud cake creatures lying in your arms  
What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants?  
He looked so baffled and bewildered  
When he played and we didn't dance.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight

Just a minute before you touch the door  
What is it that you're trying to achieve, girl?  
Do you think we can talk about it some more?  
You know the streets are filled with vipers  
Who've lost all ray of hope  
You know, it ain't even safe no more  
In the palace of the Pope.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
Come over here from over there, girl  
Sit down here, you can have my chair  
I can't see us going anywhere, girl  
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can't take you there  
I wish I'd have been a doctor  
Maybe I'd have saved some life that had been lost  
Maybe I'd have done some good in the world  
'Stead of burning every bridge I crossed.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow is never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
I ain't too good at conversation, girl  
So you might not know exactly how I feel  
But if I could, I'd bring you to the mountaintop, girl  
And build you a house made out of stainless steel  
But it's like I'm stuck inside a painting  
My throat start to tickle and my nose itches  
But I know that I can't move.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's gone but the past lives on  
Tomorrow's just one step beyond  
And I need you, yeah.  
  
Who are these people who are walking towards you  
Do you know them or will there be a fight?  
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through  
Can they tell you what's wrong from right?  
  
Do you remember St. James Street  
Where you blew Jackie P.'s mind?  
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet  
And laid his life on the line.  
  
Let's try to get beneath the surface waste, girl  
No more booby traps and bombs  
No more decadence and charm  
No more affection that's been misplaced, girl  
No more mud cake creatures lying in your arms  
What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants?  
He looked so baffled and bewildered  
When he played and we didn't dance.  
  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
I just don't think that I could handle it  
Don't fall apart on me tonight  
Yesterday's just a memory  
Tomorrow's never what it's supposed to be  
And I need you, yeah."
Bob Dylan,"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right","It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe  
It don't matter, anyhow  
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe

Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say  
To try and make me change my mind and stay

It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal  
Like you never did before  
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal  
I can't hear you any more  
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wond'rin' all the way down the road  
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told  
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul  
But don't think twice, it's all right  
  
I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe  
Where I'm bound, I can't tell  
But goodbye's too good a word, gal  
So I'll just say fare thee well  
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind  
You could have done better but I don't mind  
You just kinda wasted my precious time

Bob Dylan,Drifter's Escape,"""Oh, help me in my weakness,""  
I heard the drifter say,  
As they carried him from the courtroom  
And were taking him away.  
""My trip hasn't been a pleasant one  
And my time it isn't long,  
And I still do not know  
What it was that I've done wrong.""  
  
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside,  
A tear came to his eye,  
""You fail to understand,"" he said,  
""Why must you even try?""  
Outside, the crowd was stirring,  
You could hear it from the door.  
Inside, the judge was stepping down,  
While the jury cried for more.  
  
""Oh, stop that cursed jury,""  
Cried the attendant and the nurse,  
""The trial was bad enough,  
But this is ten times worse.""  
Just then a bolt of lightning  
Struck the courthouse out of shape,  
And while ev'rybody knelt to pray  
The drifter did escape.

Bob Dylan,Dusty Old Fairgrounds,"by Bob Dylan  
  
Well, it's all up from Florida at the start of the spring,  
The trucks and the trailers will be winding  
Like a bullet we'll shoot for the carnival route.  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
From the Michigan mud past the Wisconsin sun  
'Cross that Minnesota border, keep 'em scrambling  
Through the clear county lakes and the lumberjack lands,  
We're following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Hit Fargo on the jump and down to Aberdeen  
'Cross them old Black Hills, keep 'em rolling  
Through the cow country towns and the sands of old Montana.  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the white line on the highway sails under your wheels,  
I've gazed from the trailer window laughing.  
Oh, our clothes they was torn but the colors they was bright.  
Following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-many a friend that follows the bend,  
The jugglers, the hustlers, the gamblers.  
Well, I've spent my time with the fortune-telling kind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Oh, it's pound down the rails and it's tie down the tents,  
Get that canvas flag a-flying.  
Well, let the caterpillars spin, let the ferris wheel wind  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Well, it's roll into town straight to the fairgrounds  
Just behind the posters that are hanging  
And it's fill up every space with a different kind of face  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
Get the dancing girls in front, get the gambling show behind,  
Hear that old music box a-banging.  
Hear them kids, faces, smiles, up and down the midway aisles  
We're following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
It's a-drag it on down by the deadline in the town,  
Hit the old highway by the morning  
And it's ride yourself blind for the next town on time  
Following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
As the harmonicas whined in the lonesome nighttime  
Drinking red wine as we're rolling,  
Many a turnin' I turn, many a lesson I learn  
From following them fairgrounds a-calling.  
  
And it's roll back down to St. Petersburg  
Tie down the trailers and camp 'em  
And the money that we made will pay for the space  
From following them dusty old fairgrounds a-calling.

Bob Dylan,Emotionally Yours,"Come baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where I once begun  
Come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you're the one  
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind the closed door  
But I will always be emotionally yours.  
  
Come baby, rock me, come baby, locl me into the shadows of your heart  
Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start  
I could be dreaming but I keep believing you're the one I'm living for  
And I will always be emotionally yours.  
  
It's like my whole life never happened  
When I see you, it's if I never had a thought  
I know this dream, it might be crazy  
But it's the only one I got. Okay.  
  
Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied  
Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide  
I could be unraveling wherever I'm traveling, even to foreign shores  
But I will always be emotionally yours.

Bob Dylan,Floater,"Down over the window  
From the dazzling sunlit rays  
Through the back alleys, through the blinds  
Another one of them endless days  
  
Honey bees are buzzing  
Leaves begin to stir  
I'm in love with my second cousin  
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her  
  
I keep listening for footsteps  
But I ain't never hearing any  
From the boat, I fish for bullheads  
I catch a lot, sometimes too many  
  
A summer breeze is blowin'  
A squall is setting in  
Sometimes it's just plain stupid  
To get into any kind of wind  
  
Well the old men 'round here  
Sometimes they get on bad terms  
With the younger men,  
Old, young, age don't carry weight  
It doesn't matter in the end  
  
One of the boss' hangers-on  
Sometimes comes to call  
At times you least expect  
Tryin' to bully you, strongarm you,  
Inspire you with fear  
It has the opposite effect  
  
There's a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town  
The old one is long gone  
10 foot, 2 foot, 6 across  
Burns with the bark still on  
  
They say times are hard  
If you don't believe it you can follow your nose  
It don't bother me, times are hard anywhere  
We'll just have to see how it goes  
  
My old man, he's like some feudal lord  
He's got more lives than a cat  
I've never seen him quarrel with my mother even once  
Things come alive or they fall flat  
  
You can smell the pine wood burnin'  
You can hear the school bell ring  
Got to get up near the teacher, if you can  
If you wanna learn anything  
  
Romeo, he said to Juliet, you got a poor complexion  
It don't give you an appearance or a youthful touch  
Juliet said back to Romeo,  
Why don't you just shove off,  
If it bothers you so much  
  
They got outta here any way they could  
Cold rain can give you the shivers  
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee,  
All the rest of them rebel rivers  
  
If you ever try to interfere with me  
Or cross my path again,  
You do so at the peril of your life  
I'm not quite as cool, or forgiving as I sound  
I've seen enough heartache and strife  
  
My grandfather was a duck trapper,  
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes [?]  
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth,  
I don't know if they had any dreams or hopes.  
  
I had 'em once, though I suppose  
To go along with all the ring dancing,  
Christmas carols and all the Christmas eves  
I left all my dreams and hopes  
Buried under tobacco leaves  
  
Not always easy kicking someone up  
Got to wait awhile, it can be an unpleasant task  
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up  
And tears or not, it's too much to ask.

Just a little shanty by the railroad track  
Freight train was it taught me how to cry  
Hummin' of the driver was my lullaby  
I got the freight train blues  
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes  
And when the whistle blows I gotta go baby, don't you know  
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.  
  
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my old ma here,  
She was the only daughter of the engineer  
My sweetheart loved a brakeman and it ain't no joke  
It's a shame the way she keeps a good man broke

And when the whistle blows I gotta go oh mama, don't you know  
Well, it looks like I'm never gonna lose the freight train blues.

I never can go, because you know

You know, there's two ol' maids layin' in the bed,  
One picked herself up an' the other one, she said:  
""Get your rocks off!  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)""  
  
Well, you know, there late one night up on Blueberry Hill,  
One man turned to the other man and said, with a blood-curdlin' chill, he
said:  
""Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)""  
  
Well, you know, we was layin' down around Mink Muscle Creek,  
One man said to the other man, he began to speak, he said:  
""Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)""  
  
Well, you know, we was cruisin' down the highway in a Greyhound bus.  
All kinds-a children in the side road, they was hollerin' at us, sayin':  
""Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)

You know, there's two ol' maids layin' in the bed,  
One picked herself up an' the other one, she said:  
""Get your rocks off!  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)""  
  
Well, you know, there late one night up on Blueberry Hill,  
One man turned to the other man and said, with a blood-curdlin' chill, he
said:  
""Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)""  
  
Well, you know, we was layin' down around Mink Muscle Creek,  
One man said to the other man, he began to speak, he said:  
""Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off-a me! (Get 'em off!)""  
  
Well, you know, we was cruisin' down the highway in a Greyhound bus.  
All kinds-a children in the side road, they was hollerin' at us, sayin':  
""Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off! (Get 'em off!)  
Get your rocks off-a me! """
Bob Dylan,Girl Of The North Country,"If you're travelin' in the North Country fair  
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to one who lives there  
For she once was a true love of mine  
If you go when the snowflakes storm  
When the rivers freeze and summer ends  
Please see she has a coat so warm  
To keep her from the howlin' winds  
Please see if her hair hangs long  
If it rolls and flows all down her breast  
Please see for me if her hair's hanging long  
For that's the way I remember her best  
I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all  
Many times I've often prayed  
In the darkness of my night  
In the brightness of my day  
So if you're travelin' the North Country fair  
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline  
Remember me to one who lives there  
For she once was a true love of mine

Bob Dylan,"Going, Going, Gone","I've just reached a place  
Where the willow don't bend.  
There's not much more to be said  
It's the top of the end.  
I'm going,  
I'm going,  
I'm gone.  
  
I'm closin' the book  
On the pages and the text  
And I don't really care  
What happens next.  
I'm just going,  
I'm going,  
I'm gone.  
  
I been hangin' on threads,  
I been playin' it straight,  
Now, I've just got to cut loose  
Before it gets late.  
So I'm going,  
I'm going,  
I'm gone.  
  
Grandma said, ""Boy, go and follow your heart  
And you'll be fine at the end of the line.  
All that's gold isn't meant to shine.  
Don't you and your one true love ever part.""  
  
I been walkin' the road,  
I been livin' on the edge,  
Now, I've just got to go  
Before I get to the ledge.  
So I'm going,  
I'm just going,  
I'm gone.

Bob Dylan,Golden Loom,"Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky,  
I see the sailin' boats across the bay go by.  
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street  
And then I turn my head, for you're approachin' me.  
Moonlight on the water, fisherman's daughter, floatin' in to my room  
With a golden loom.  
  
First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine  
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine.  
I see the hungry clouds up above your face  
And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste.  
And then you drift away on a summer's day where the wildflowers bloom  
With your golden loom.  
  
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light  
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night.  
I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail  
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil.  
But you're gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume  
And your golden loom.

But I've been told streets up there  
Are lined with gold

Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on  
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on.

Bob Dylan,Handsome Molly,"Well, I wish I was in London,  
Or some other seaport town  
I'd put my foot on a steamboat  
I'd sail the ocean 'round.  
While sailing 'round the ocean,  
While sailing 'round the sea  
I'd think of handsome molly  
Wherever she might be.  
Don't you remember, molly  
You gave me your right hand?  
You said whenever you'd marry  
I would be the man.  
But you broke your promise  
Go with whom you please  
My poor heart is aching  
You are at your ease.  
I went to church last Sunday  
Molly came ridin' by  
I could tell her mind was changin'  
By the rovin' of her eye.  
I go down to the river  
Though everyone's asleep  
I think of handsome molly  
An' I begin to weep.  
So I wish I was in London,  
Or some other seaport town  
I'd put my foot on a steamboat  
I'd sail the ocean 'round.

Bob Dylan,House Carpenter,"Well met, well met, my own true love  
Well met, well met, cried she  
I've just returned from the salt, salt sea  
And it's all for the love of thee  
  
I could have married a King's daughter there  
She would have married me  
But I have forsaken my King's daughter there  
It's all for the love of thee  
  
Well, if you could have married a King's daughter there  
I'm sure you're the one to blame  
For I am married to a house carpenter  
And I'm sure he's a fine young man  
  
Forsake, forsake your house carpenter  
And come away with me  
I'll take you where the green grass grows  
On the shores of sunny Italy  
  
So up she picked her babies three  
And gave them kisses, one, two, three  
Saying ""take good care of your daddy while I'm gone  
And keep him good company.""  
  
Well, they were sailin' about two weeks  
I'm sure it was not three  
When the younger of the girls, she came on deck  
Sayin' she wants company  
  
""Well, are you weepin' for your house and home?  
Or are you weepin' for your babies three?""  
""Well, I'm not weepin' for my house carpenter  
I'm weepin' for my babies three.""

They look as white as snow  
Those are the hill of heaven, my love  
You and I'll never know  
  
Oh what are those hills yonder, my love  
They look as dark as night  
Those are the hills of hell-fire my love  
Where you and I will unite  
  
Oh twice around went the gallant ship  
I'm sure it was not three  
When the ship all of a sudden, it sprung a leak  
And it drifted to the bottom of the sea

Lord I've tried and I've tried  
and all night long I've cried  
But I can't get you off of my mind.  
  
Didn't think you would leave me behind  
But I guess you're the two-timin' kind  
Do you think that it's smart to jump from heart to heart  
When I can't get you off of my mind.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You believe that a true love is blind  
So you fool ev'ry new love you find  
You've got stars in your eyes but they can't hide the lies  
Oh, I can't get you off my mind.

Bob Dylan,I Feel A Change Comin' On,"Well I'm lookin' the world over  
Looking far off into the east

And the last part of the day's already gone

We strive for the same old ends

I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
Well now what's the use in dreaming  
You got better things to do  
Dreams never did work for me anyway  
Even when they did come true  
  
You are as porous as ever  
Baby you can start a fire  
I must be losing my mind  
You're the object of my desire  
I feel a change comin' on  
And the fourth part of the day's already gone  
  
I'm listening to Billy Joe Shaver  
And I'm reading James Joyce

I got the blood of the land in my voice

Everybody got all the beautiful clothes  
Everybody got all the flowers

Bob Dylan,In The Summertime,"I was in your presence for an hour or so  
Or was it a day?  
I truly don't know  
Where the sun never set, where the trees hung low  
By that soft and shining sea  
Did you respect me for what I did  
Or what I didn't do, or keeping it hid?  
Did I lose my mind when I tried to get rid  
Of everything you see?  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.  
  
I got the heart and you got the blood  
We cut through iron and we cut through mud  
Then came the warning that was before the flood  
That set everybody free  
Fools they made a mock of sin  
Our loyalty they tried to win  
But you were closer to me than my next of kin  
When they didn't want to know or see.  
  
In the summertime, ah in the summertime  
In the summertime, when you were with me.  
  
Strangers, they meddled in our affairs  
Poverty and shame were theirs  
But all that suffering was not to be compared  
With the glory that is to be  
And I'm still carrying the gift you gave  
It's a part of me now, it's been cherished and saved  
It'll go with me unto the grave  
And into eternity.

Watch your never-ending flight  
Just how high as high to be before you see the light  
Will this be the change you need to show you who you are  
I love you but I'll leave you just to prove you've gone too far  
  
Soon I'm gonna leave you just because I want you  
Back where you belong  
Gonna make you see just what you've doing to me  
Back where you belong  
Be home right by my side is where you want to be  
Back where you belong  
  
Can't you see you're losing me using me  
Back where you belong  
Heaven knows I love you will this make you see  
Back where you belong  
  
So I'm gonna leave you just because I want you  
Back where you belong  
Gonna make you see just what you've doing to me  
Back where you belong  
Be home right by my side is where you want to be  
Back where you belong  
  
Don't you understand my feelings and  
Set me free  
Don't you realize it..."

Donna Summer,Be Myself Again,"Let me introduce myself  
I'm a woman that you've never seen  
You might know me from somewhere else  
As someone that I've never been.  
  
I gave everything to play the game  
My soul fell apart at the seams  
I fell down like a house of cards  
When somebody pulled the queen.  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause you could spend your life  
Lookin' for your own reflection  
Time could blur the lines  
Between what's real and what's projected  
Had I known what I lost?  
What I gained, what it'd cost  
I'd still give what remains  
To be myself again.  
  
You must believe me when I say  
Don't live someone else's design  
Turn it around like a photograph  
The writings been there all the time.  
  
Now you can have all these hopes and dreams  
The ones I can't use anymore  
I don't know what it is you lost  
But I hope you got what you came for.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I want to leave right now  
Sometimes I want to cry out loud  
I want to let it all hang out  
But I don't want to let you down.  
  
Sometimes I want to just lay here  
Sometimes I want to disappear  
I want to show you all my fear  
But I don't want to let you down.

Donna Summer,Domino,"Late last night at a fancy dress ball  
I was dancing with all the queens and lords  
When a tall and mystic man took me by the hand  
And began dancing my eyes away  
  
Domino, domino, domino  
Who's the man behind the mask I'd like to know  
Who's this masquerading lover  
I wish I could discover  
Domino, domino, domino  
  
I was feeling so dizzy and lame  
Was it champagne or really him to blame  
Though our faces were disguised  
Feelings couldn't hide  
That this wasn't just some kind of game  
  
Domino, domino, domino  
Who's the man behind the mask I'd like to know  
Who's this masquerading lover  
I wish I could discover  
Domino, domino, domino  
  
Domino who are you  
Domino I'd like to know  
Domino who's the real domino  
Though we're strangers still  
It's real love I feel domino  
  
Then at midnight the bells were all rung  
And he kisses me and held me in his arms  
Then a crowd would ride between us  
Trapped away my stranger  
And I never did find him again

Donna Summer,Don't Cry For Me Argentina,"This won't be easy  
You'll think it's strange  
When I try to explain how I feel  
That I still need your love  
After all that I've done  
  
You won't believe me  
All you will see is a girl you once knew  
Although she's dressed up to nines  
For sixes and sevens with you  
  
I had to let it happen  
I had to change  
Couldn't stay all my life down at heel  
Looking out of the window  
Staying out of the sun  
So I choose freedom  
Running around, trying everything new  
But nothing impressed me at all  
I never expected it too  
  
Don't cry for me, Argentina  
The truth is I never left you  
All through my wild days  
My mad existence  
I kept my promise, don't keep your distance  
  
And as for fortune  
And as for fame  
I never invited them in  
Though it appeared to the world  
They were all I desired  
They are illusions  
They're not the solutions they promised to be  
The answer was here all the time  
I love you, and hope you love me

Guess I've always been  
He doesn't know he's all I'm living for

I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work that hard  
Don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work that hard  
Not if it makes me cry  
No no no no no no  
I don't wanna work  
I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work it if makes me cry  
  
Spent last night  
Talking to myself in bed  
Wondering why I do this over  
Over and over again  
I don't know  
I, I, I, I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work that hard  
Not when it makes me cry  
  
I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work not that hard  
I don't wanna work it it makes me cry  
I don't wanna work that hard  
I don't wanna work not that hard  
I don't wanna work if it makes me cry"

Donna Summer,I Need Time,"Five to nine  
Early Sunday morning around breakfast time  
I heard a sudden tapping at the kitchen door  
Oh and there was more  
Well it was you I saw  
No mistake  
I knew you'd come around that sad look on your face  
Then you begged me to come in and I said yes  
Oh what a fool I am  
I should have turned away  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
To let it all hang out  
To fight my fear and fight my doubt  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
(get ahold) of love  
Spoken words don't mean enough  
No mistake  
Remember not to break the promise that you make  
I'll meet you fifty fifty in the middle now  
And I won't back out  
There'd better be no doubt  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Little did I know that love would bring you to my door  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Little did I know that love was on our side  
I love you you know I  
You know I always will love you now  
I know I do love you  
You know I'll always be true to you my love  
Here you stand  
Torn up yellow T-shirt and guitar in hand  
I wanna love you now  
Oh forget the past  
I wanna make love last  
I need time  
To turn the time around  
Let it all hang out  
Love will bring you back again  
I need time  
To turn the time around

Donna Summer,I Remember Yesterday,"I remember that first night we met,  
Dancing to the sounds of clarinets,  
Dancing cheek to cheek, oh how sweet,  
You and me and this fantasy,  
Oh I remember our first night.  
  
I remember how we carried on,  
On and on until the light of dawn.  
From the very start, you stole my heart,  
I knew right then we would never part,  
Oh I remember that first night.  
  
Remember that first night,  
Remember that first night.  
  
I saw your love light through the candle's glow,  
Champagne was flowing, and so I let myself go,  
And when the night was over, we both looked around the room,  
Remember darling, chairs on the table, and only me and you  
  
I remember how we carried on,  
On and on until the light of dawn,  
And from the very start, you stole my heart,  
I knew right then we would never part.

Donna Summer,I Will Survive,"At First I was afriad I was petrified kept  
Think how I'm going to live without you by me side?  
But, then I spend so many nights just thinking how you  
Did me wrong but I grew strong and I learned how to get along  
And now you back from outer space  
Don't turn around,  
Cause your not welcome any more,  
Weren't you the one who tried  
To hurt me with goodbye  
You'd think I'd crumble youd think I'd lay down and die  
Now go now go, walk out the door

Donna Summer,Love's Unkind,"Well I seem him every morning in the schoolyard  
When the school bell rings  
And when he passes in the hallway  
Well he doesn't seem to notice me  
  
He's got a crush on my best friend  
But she don't care, 'cause she loves someone else  
I'm standing on the outside, no the inside where I wanna be  
  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
Love's unkind, love's unkind  
'Cause he's not mine

Hoping he would choose me for his partner  
For the high school dance  
I was standing outside the class  
  
But it wasn't me, but my best friend, he asked  
I went running back inside teary-eyed  
And left the two of them behind  
  
Love's unkind, love's unkind

Oh, how I love him, but I can't even let him know

But she don't care, she loves someone else  
And I asked my mama, and she said: love's unkind

Donna Summer,Lush Life,"I used to visit the very gay places  
Those come what may places  
Where one relaxes on the axis  
Of the wheel of life  
To get the feel of life  
From jazz and cocktails  
  
All the men I knew had sad and  
Sullen gray faces  
With distingue traces  
That used to be there  
You could see where  
They'd been washed away  
By too many through the day  
Twelve o'clock tales  
  
Then you came along with your  
Siren song  
To tempt me to madness  
I knew all the while  
That your poignant smile  
Was tinged with the sadness of a  
Great love for me  
Oh, yes I was wrong  
Again I was wrong  
  
Now life is lonely again  
And only last year everything  
Seemed so sure  
Now life is awful again  
A troughful of hearts would only  
Be a bore  
A week in Paris will ease the bite  
Of it  
But all I really care  
Is to smile in spite of it  
I'll forget you  
I will and yet you are still  
Burning inside my brain  
  
Romance is mush, stifling those  
Who strive  
I'll live a lush life in some  
Small dive  
And there I'll be  
While I rot with the rest  
Of those whose lives are  
Lonely too

Donna Summer,Mac Arthur Park,"Spring was never waiting for us, dear  
It ran one step ahead  
As we followed in the dance  
  
[Chorus]  
MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark  
All the sweet, green icing flowing down  
Someone left the cake out in the rain  
I don't think that I can take it  
'Cause it took so long to bake it  
And I'll never have that recipe again  
Oh, no!  
  
I recall the yellow cotton dress  
Foaming like a wave  
On the ground beneath your knees  
The birds, like tender babies in your hands  
And the old men playing Chinese checkers by the trees

Donna Summer,Mimi's Song,"Spoken:  
You know tonight is a very important night  
For me for a number of reasons  
My little girl is here tonight  
And I don't think you understand  
What it's like being the daughter of  
Someone who's always gone  
It's kind of scary and it's kind of lonely  
And I guess she thinks to herself sometimes  
""Is mummy ever going ever gonna come home?""  
And so my daughter looked up at me  
Last week and she said ""mummy  
When are you just gonna stay home  
One day and be with me""?  
And so it kinda struck me funny  
And I didn't realize that I hadn't spent  
Anytime with her for a long time  
So I sat down and wrote down this song  
After she went to bed  
And I told her tonight when it was bedtime  
I would sing her son  
I bet you ask yourself  
Why I'm never there  
It's not because I like being away  
You see I've made a spectacle of myself  
And it seems that the whole world needs me  
I understand when you cry alone  
And mama's not there to wipe your eyes  
You see it's only because  
I'm out being someone to make you cry  
I got a little letter  
And I read it on the plane  
And in my heart I felt a funny kind of pain  
I wish that I could be there  
To touch your face again  
Mimi you're beautiful  
Mimi you're mine  
And other things that I do in my life  
Seem to take up all your precious time  
There's so much I long to say  
So much more I long to do  
But I guess it's all just have to wait  
Till I can get to see you  
Mimi you're mine  
Oh, Mimi you're mine  
Oh, Mimi you fill my life  
You fill my life with so much love  
Cause you're beautiful  
And you love me  
And you'll understand  
Mimi it's bedtime say Goodnight  
""Goodnight""

And mama's not there to wipe your eyes  
You see it's only because  
I'm out being someone to make you cry  
I got a little letter  
And I read it on the plane  
And in my heart I felt a funny kind of pain  
I wish that I could be there  
To touch your face again  
Mimi you're beautiful  
Mimi you're mine  
And other things that I do in my life  
Seem to take up all your precious time  
There's so much I long to say  
So much more I long to do  
But I guess it's all just have to wait  
Till I can get to see you  
Mimi you're mine  
Oh, Mimi you're mine  
Oh, Mimi you fill my life  
You fill my life with so much love  
Cause you're beautiful  
And you love me  
And you'll understand  
Mimi it's bedtime say Goodnight  
""Goodnight"""

Donna Summer,My Life,"When I was young  
I used to dream of going far  
Having my once in a lifetime  
Chance to prove I was a star  
A thousand times I stood in  
The wings dreaming it was me  
I heard the people going wild  
But it was just my fantasy  
Life is a dance  
Maybe we're all players  
So stand up and smile  
And don't be afraid  
  
This is my night  
This is my song  
Standing right here out on  
The stage is where I belong  
  
This is my song  
This is my night  
Standing right here out on  
The stage in the spotlight  
Whoo hoo  
  
I traveled the road  
Wherever the road would lead  
I made mistakes  
But I wouldn't quit  
I made myself believe  
Dreams come true for those who  
Dream, so one day you can say  
If the music be the fruit of life  
Then let my music play  
  
Life is a dance

Donna Summer,My Man Medley,"Spoken:  
I just wanna say this  
This is something I thing most of you ladies will identify with  
And maybe some of you men too  
(the man I love)  
Someday he'll come along  
The man I love  
And he'll be rich and strong  
The man I love  
And when he comes my way  
I'll do my best to make him stay  
He'll look at me and smile  
I'll understand  
And maybe for awhile  
He'll take my hand  
And though it seems absurd  
I know we both won't say a word  
Spoken:  
You know I'm the kind of lady  
That always seems to find the wrong man  
At the wrong place at the wrong time  
It's not that I go out looking for him  
But somehow he always seems to find me  
You see what I'm looking for is the kind of man  
That comes home with candy  
And flowers sayin' ""come on put on your dancing shoes  
Cause we're gonna wine and dine, wine and dine""  
But what I always seem to find is the kind of man  
That comes home fussing  
And fighting, breaking my best dishes  
And beat my head outside the wall  
Shows no love no respect and nothing at all  
(I got it bad and that ain't good)  
Never treats me sweet and gentle  
The way he should  
I got it bad and that ain't good!  
(no, it ain't good at all, you know)  
Spoken:  
Listen, have you been treating your lady nice lately, you have?  
And how about you?  
Great, well I've been gettin' rocked completely!  
My poor heart is sentimental it's not made of wood  
I got it bad and that ain't good  
Spoken:  
So you see on Monday nights  
I just go out and drink and drink  
But when the weekend's over on Monday rolls aroun'  
I end up like I start out just cryin' my heart out  
Cryin' my heart out  
Lord above me (come on) make him love me  
Then he should  
I got it bad baby  
I got it bad baby  
I got it bad and that ain't good!  
No it ain't good at all you know  
Spoken:  
But listen mister big shot I've got your number  
And I'll take care of you  
And you too and you and you and you  
(some of these days)  
Some of these days  
You're gonna miss your donna  
Some of these days  
You're gonna feel so lonely  
You'll miss my huggin'  
You'll miss my kissin'

Donna Summer,Mystery Of Love,"Seasons are changing

Donna Summer,On The Radio,"Someone found a letter you wrote me, on the radio  
And they told the world just how you felt  
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat  
They never said your name  
But I knew just who they meant.  
  
Whoa I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered, too  
If by chance you heard it for yourself  
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you  
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air  
  
On the radio  
Whoa, oh, oh  
On the radio  
Whoa oh oh oh  
On the radio  
Whoa, oh, oh  
On the radio  
Whoa, oh, oh  
  
Now, now  
Don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song  
Things are not the same since we broke up last June  
The only thing that I want to hear is that you love me still  
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon  
  
Whoa, oh, yeah, yeah  
And it made me feel proud when I heard you say  
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself  
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really feel  
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air  
  
On the radio  
Whoa, oh, oh  
On the radio  
Whoa, oh, oh  
On the radio  
Whoa, oh, oh

Whoa oh oh  
On the radio  
  
If you think that love isn't found on the radio  
Well tune right in you made find the love you lost  
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago  
It sounded really loud , they said it really loud

","Someone found a letter you wrote me, on the radio  
And they told the world just how you felt  
It must have fallen out of a hole in your old brown overcoat  
They never said your name  
But I knew just who they meant.  
  
Whoa I was so surprised and shocked, and I wondered, too  
If by chance you heard it for yourself  
I never told a soul just how I've been feeling over you  
But they said it really loud, they said it on the air  
  
On the radio  
Whoa, oh, oh

Now, now  
Don't it kinda strike you sad when you hear our song  
Things are not the same since we broke up last June  
The only thing that I want to hear is that you love me still  
And that you think you'll be comin' home real soon  
  
Whoa, oh, yeah, yeah  
And it made me feel proud when I heard you say  
You couldn't find the words to say it yourself  
And now in my heart I know I can say what I really feel  
'Cause they said it really loud, they said it on the air  
  
On the radio  
Whoa, oh, oh

If you think that love isn't found on the radio  
Well tune right in you made find the love you lost  
'Cause now I'm sitting here with the man I sent away long ago  
It sounded really loud , they said it really loud

Donna Summer,The Man I Love,"[Spoken:]  
I just wanna say this  
This is something I thing most of you ladies will identify with  
And maybe some of you men too  
  
  
Someday he'll come along  
The man I love  
And he'll be rich and strong  
The man I love  
And when he comes my way  
I'll do my best to make him stay  
  
He'll look at me and smile  
I'll understand  
And maybe for awhile  
He'll take my hand  
And though it seems absurd  
I know we both won't say a word  
  
[Spoken:]  
You know I'm the kind of lady  
That always seems to find the wrong man  
At the wrong place at the wrong time  
It's not that I go out looking for him  
But somehow he always seems to find me  
You see what I'm looking for is the kind of man  
That comes home with candy  
And flowers sayin' ""come on put on your dancing shoes  
Cause we're gonna wine and dine, wine and dine""  
But what I always seem to find is the kind of man  
That comes home fussing  
And fighting, breaking my best dishes  
And beat my head outside the wall  
Shows no love no respect and nothing at all

Donna Summer,"Theme From The Deep (Down, Deep Inside)","Down deep inside  
There's a place in me I'm yearning to explore  
Look in my eyes  
And remember wine, the music and amour  
The days grow stronger and longer  
With every glance  
It's what a stare and the dance were  
To find romance  
While dancers dance so close  
Deep inside to our dream of dreams  
Our theme of themes  
Romance  
Yes I'm falling watch me falling  
Something warm is turning inside of me  
Something warm is burning inside of me

Donna Summer,(Theme) Once Upon A Time,"(Voice monologue over ""Once Upon A Time"" instrumental)  
  
Once upon a time, there was a girl  
She lived in the land of never-never  
Where everything real is unreal  
And only fairy tales come true  
Something like me and you  
  
But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real  
So she strived on to make it come true  
Fighting odds, not knowing what would come of her  
Never giving up the hope within her  
  
She carried on and on, because she believed  
That once, once in a time in her lifetime  
The things so unreal would be real  
  
And in the morning, one day when she awoke  
To find herself surrounded by the same old room  
She was disappointed  
  
So she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she said that fairy tales do come true  
'cause I believe, I believe  
  
And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting  
Till one day she met a man who held her tight  
And she fell in love  
  
Once upon a time, in the land of never-never  
Where all things real are unreal  
There lived a girl who believed  
That all things could be possible  
  
And one day she did awake  
And found herself somewhere else  
Beside her a brand new face  
Of someone that she loved

A better rain  
The kind that comes in off the coast and paints the sky  
And lets you know that God's alive  
A better rain  
That'll wash me from your eyes so you can smile again  
And be all right again  
In a better rain  
  
Someday is gonna find you in a sweeter place  
Long after time has erased  
All the words like razor blades  
You'll remember you and me before the flood  
Once upon a time in love, a beautiful us  
I can see you on some stretch of sand  
Spinin' round in circles barefoot dancin' in  
  
A better rain  
That'll leave behind a rainbow in the sky  
Lets you know that God's alive  
A better rain  
That'll wash me from your eyes so you can smile again  
And be all right again  
In a better rain  
  
A better rain  
That'll leave a rainbow in the sky  
Lets you know that God's alive  
In a better rain  
A better rain"
George Strait,A Fire I Can't Put Out,"I'm finding out how hot an old flame can burn.  
You're a feeling I haven't forgot, the love I can't unlearn.  
You've become a memory I can't live without.  
You'll always be a fire I can't put out.  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't know how to handle the dream you left behind.  
It's like a lighted candle burning up my mind.  
At least I'm happy knowing what love is all about.  
You'll always be a fire I can't put out.  
  
Embers to ashes, that's how it should be.  
You'd think by now my heart would know, and it could set you free.  
The things I've tried, the tears I've cried, I guess there's no doubt  
You'll always be a fire I can't put out.

You'll always be a fire I can't put out.

George Strait,A Heart Like Hers,"Every time that someone walks in  
She turns around to see if it's him  
She checks her watch by the clock  
I can't count the times he's stood her up  
And one's too much  
  
[Chorus]  
How could anybody break a heart like hers  
I can't stand to watch her hurt  
I would gladly take his place  
If she'd just love me that way  
He must not know what it's worth  
I don't understand how anyone  
Could break a heart like hers  
  
She keeps saying he'll change someday  
He wasn't always this way  
She things he hung the moon and stars  
But all he's done is string her along like this  
It don't make sense

I've always been free I never could see me dragin' no ball and chain  
I like running around and being tied down never was my cup of tea

And I'm beginning to like just sittin' and holding hands  
Looking into her eyes I'm thinking bout future plans

Ain't all it's cracked up to be

George Strait,All My Ex's Live In Texas,"[Chorus]

And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be  
But all my ex's live in Texas  
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee  
  
Rosanna's down in Texarkana

And Allison's in Galveston  
Somehow lost her sanity  
And Dimple's who now lives in Temple's  
Got the law looking for me

Where I learned to swim  
But it brings to mind another time  
Where I wore my welcome thin

I go there each night  
But I always come back to myself  
Long before daylight  
  
All my ex's live in Texas  
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be

George Strait,Breath You Take,"He looks up from second base  
Dad's up in the stands  
He saw the hit, the run, the slide  
There ain't no bigger fan  
  
In the parking lot after the game  
He said ""Dad I thought you had a plane to catch?""  
He smiled and said ""Yeah son I did""  
  
But life's not the breath you take  
The breathing in and out  
That gets you through the day  
Ain't what its all about  
You just might miss the point  
Trying to win the race  
Life's not the breaths you take  
But the moments that take your breath away  
  
Fast forward fifteen years  
And a thousand miles away  
Boys built a life, he's got a wife  
And a baby due today  
He hears a voice saying ""I made it son""  
Says ""I told you Dad, you didn't have to come""

The more she bakes the more I eat  
And sometimes I can't get myself to stop

And they're absolutely impossible to resist  
Some disappear to who knows where  
But I make sure I get my share  
And those kids just stand there waiting for the ones I miss

That you might have overlooked or missed  
So now let me tell you the best part of it all

George Strait,Come On Joe,"Well, it's a long, hot night  
And the stars are shining kinda extra bright  
Sitting on the back porch glidin'  
Whetting my appetite  
  
Well, I'm a six-pack high  
And start missing the light of my baby's eyes  
Wasn't it beautiful, the kind of a soul they said would never die  
  
Well, it's muggy in the shack  
And the backwoods are black  
'Cause the clouds hid the moon away  
The light from my cigarette flickers in the dark  
The only way she knows I'm here  
Then suddenly the sounds of the fiddles and accordions  
Sweetly begin to play and I can almost hear her sweet voice say  
  
[Chorus]  
Come on Joe, just count to ten  
Pull yourself together again  
And come on Joe, you gotta get hold of this mood you're in  
Come on Joe, you gotta be strong  
You're still young and life goes on to carry on  
'Til we're together again  
  
Hey, I know she's right  
But it's hard to fight when you're hurtin' so  
I tried to walk out of that door before but I just can't go  
With the tears and the laughter in every rafter in every room  
Wasn't it beautiful  
Wasn't it the kind of happiness and glow

George Strait,Don't Tell Me You're Not In Love,"I know you're ready, you show all the signs

But you keep saying  
You can't take another heartache  
The way you hold me, the way that you move  
Your feelings keep showing through  
You can't hide it  
It's written all over your face  
Don't tell me you're not in love

From out on a mountain  
To both knees on the ground

Baby, drink up this love, give it all we got tonight

","July moonlight shines  
Your pretty little head on my shoulder  
Pull over on the side of the road  
Oh my God, you're something  
Like nothing I've ever seen  
If I'm asleep girl, let me dream  
  
Baby fall into my kiss  
It should just happen like this  
Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and  
This moment that says it's so right  
'Cause that's all we have in this life  
Drink up this love, baby, give it all we got tonight  
  
Summer honeysuckle  
Leaking through a rolled down window  
We both know when that seat lays back  
Anything can happen  
So imagine it'll never end  
Just close your eyes and you can see that we are where we're meant to be  
  
Baby fall into my kiss  
It should just happen like this  
Trust it so much that there's no one else but us and

George Strait,Give It Away,"She was stormin' through the house that day  
And I could tell she was leavin'  
And I thought, 'aw, she'll be back.'  
Until we turned around and pointed at the wall and said  
  
That picture from out honeymoon  
That night in 'Frisco Bay  
Just give it away  
She said give it away  
  
That big four poster king sized bed  
Where so much love was made  
Just give it away  
She said just give it away  
  
[Chorus]  
Just give it away  
There ain't nothing in this house worth fightin' over  
Oh, we're both tired of fightin' anyway  
Just give it away  
  
Oh, I tried to move on  
But I found that each woman I held  
Just reminded me of that day  
  
When that front door swung wide open  
She flung her diamond ring  
Said, give it away  
Just give it away  
  
And I said, now honey  
Don't you even want your half of everything  
She said give it away  
Just give it away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So, I'm still right here where she left me  
Along with all the other things that she don't care about anymore  
Hmm  
  
Like that picture from our honeymoon  
That night in 'Frisco Bay  
She said give it away  
Well, I can't give it away  
That big four poster king sized bed  
Where all our love was made  
She said give it away  
Well, I can't give it away  
  
I've got furnished house  
A diamond ring  
And a lonely, broken heart  
Full of love  
And I can't even give it away

George Strait,Give Me More Time,"A banker and a farmer discuss the bottom line,  
It ain't rained and all the crops are dying on the vine.  
Give me more time.  
You gotta give me more time.  
That farm's been in my family going on a hundred years.  
We've pulled through hard times before with blood sweat and tears.  
Give me more time,  
I need more time.  
Oh, what would he give for a little more time?  
  
Two lovers at a table candlelight and wine,  
One's looking for an answer the other one can't find.  
Give me more time, You gotta give me more time.  
She says ""You know I love you but my heart's in a bind,  
Afraid you?re gonna leave me if I don't make up my mind.""  
Give me more time, I gotta have more time.  
Some have barely any, some too much on their hands.  
Some would give anything to have it back again.  
  
A patient and his doctor meet behind closed doors,  
You kidding me? How could this be, I'm only 24. Give me more time,  
You gotta give me more time, give me more time.

Sing a song about the Heartland  
Sing a song about my life

You will always be the miracle  
That makes my life complete  
And as long as there's a breath in me  
I'll make yours just as sweet  
  
As we look into the future  
It's as far as we can see  
So let's make each tomorrow  
Be the best that it can be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And if along the way we find a day  
It starts to storm  
You've got the promise of my love  
To keep you warm  
  
In all the world  
You'll never find  
A love as true as mine  
A love as true as mine

","Our love is unconditional  
We knew it from the start  
I can see it in your eyes  
You can feel it from my heart  
  
From here on after  
Let's stay the way we are right now  
And share all the love and laughter  
That a lifetime will allow.  
  
  
I cross my heart  
And promise to  
Give all I've got to give  
To make all your dreams come true  
In all the world  
You'll never find  
A love as true as mine  
  
You will always be the miracle  
That makes my life complete  
And as long as there's a breath in me  
I'll make yours just as sweet  
  
As we look into the future  
It's as far as we can see

A love as true as mine"
George Strait,I Found Jesus On The Jailhouse Floor,"There once was a time when I was dead inside  
I cussed the Lord for the day I was born  
And prayed to the Devil to die  
Just when I thought the Devil had won  
Someone opened up the door  
The King of kings  
Lord of lords  
I found Jesus on the jailhouse floor  
  
[Chorus]  
Now, he broke the chains that bound me, and now I'm free  
Today I'm right where Mama  
Prayed I'd be  
I'm down on my knees

What Mama knew for sure  
He's King of kings  
Lord of lords

I'll tell you what he's done for me

George Strait,I Just Can't Go On Dying Like This,"I'm driving in my car alone  
You called me on the telephone  
How many times will it take till I'm convinced  
That you're using me, I'm just a used-to-be?  
It's a lie, I know it's a lie  
But I just can't go on dying like this  
  
Can I see you tonight?  
Baby, I'll act just like you want me to  
Or is that just exactly what I'm not supposed to do?  
  
I'll just stop in here, have a glass of beer  
I'm just a fool I guess  
But I just can't go on dying like this  
  
Here I am again, it's four AM  
I think I'll play that song again

George Strait,I'll Always Remember You,"It all started back in 1981.  
Our life together had just begun.  
I didn't know what my future would hold,  
But you gave me a chance,  
So I set out on the road.  
  
It wasn't easy going then.  
There were times I almost threw that old towel in,  
But you kept callin' me back to the stage,  
And I finally found my place in each and every face.  
  
I'm not sayin' I'm through by any means.  
There's still things that I want to say and do.  
I hope you won't forget me, 'cause we've shared a lot dreams.  
And just know that I'll always remember you.  
  
When I first set out on the road, I figured  
I had maybe five good years to sing my songs for you folks.  
Well, it's goin' on thirty now  
And I still love it just as much as I ever did.  
When I hear that announcer say my name,  
And I walk through those curtains  
And see your smilin' faces,  
My feet don't touch the ground again  
Til I walk out and get back on that bus that got me here.  
I don't know how many more years I've got left to do this,  
But I figure a few.  
I do want you to know, though,  
That when I do walk off this stage for the last time,  
And I'm all settled in, away from all this,  
You won't be far away.  
I'll still hear your screams and cheers in my mind.  
And I'll always remember you.

George Strait,Looking Out My Window Through The Pain,"I watched from my window as she slipped from the house  
Once again she's leaving, but Lord, she's not to blame  
This morning a memory phoned her and he's a habit she can't break  
So 'til she returns, I'll wait for her,  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
The devil drove the taxi that carried her away  
And it hurts to know she's hung up on some guy from yesterday  
Once again she's chasing memories and I'm losing everything  
But I love her, so I'll wait for her,  
Looking out my window through the pain  
  
I'll pick up the pieces when he lets her down again  
With love and understanding, I'll give her reasons this time to stay  
And I'll close my eyes pretending maybe someday she will change  
And I won't be left lonely,  
Looking out my window through the pain

George Strait,"Love Without End, Amen","I got sent home from school one day with a shiner on my eye.  
Fightin' was against the rules and it didn't matter why.  
When dad got home I told that story just like I'd rehearsed.  
And then stood there on those tremblin' knees and waited for the worst.  
  
Chorus:  
And he said, let me tell you a secret about a father's love,  
A secret that my daddy said was just between us.  
He said, daddies don't just love their children every now and then.  
It's a love without end, amen, it's a love without end, amen.

There was no doubt that stubborn boy was just like my father's son.  
And when I thought my patience had been tested to the end,  
I took my daddy's secret and I passed it on to him.

Last night I dreamed I died and stood outside those pearly gates.  
When suddenly I realized there must be some mistake.  
If they know half the things I've done, they'll never let me in.

I've seen a lot of ol' familiar faces  
But again tonight I'm goin' home alone  
  
My heart won't let me move on one but you  
My mind keeps tellin' me that just won't do  
My arms keep reachin' out for someone new  
But my heart won't let me love no one but you  
  
I've told myself a million times it's over  
You've gotta face the truth and let her go  
Just when I think I've got it all together  
Your memory walks around in side my soul  
  
My heart won't let me move on one but you  
My mind keeps tellin' me that just won't do  
My arms keep reachin' out for someone new  
But my heart won't let me love no one but you"
George Strait,Nobody In His Right Mind Would've Left Her,"I burn with desire  
each time my heart fans the fire  
To that old flame  
that burns inside of me  
She cried when I left her  
now I try to forget her  
Oh how foolish I was  
to ever want to leave  
  
[Chorus]  
Because nobody in his right mind  
would've left her  
I had to be crazy to say good bye  
Nobody in his right mind  
could've left her  
Even my heart was smart enough  
to stay behind  
  
I still carry her picture  
I wish her well

Each night finds me dreamin'  
each day I spend thinkin'  
How much I wish  
she was still around

There goes the plans that I made.  
Oh, but you won't hear me complain.  
  
An' oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you.  
When you're in my arms, I've got sunshine,

Couldn't ask for better weather,  
To do what I do:  
Oh, what a perfect day for lovin' you.  
  
So let's go grab a blanket,  
An' a hot cup of coffee,  
And sit out on the front porch and swing.  
That look in your eyes is what's on my mind:  
We don't have to say anything.

George Strait,One Foot In Front Of The Other,"Well, love can be an uphill climb  
I'm gonna meet a lot of resistance  
It takes every ounce of strength we've got  
If we're gonna go the distance  
We can get discouraged and lose our courage  
Worrying 'bout the daily grind  
But life's a journey, no need to hurry  
It's one day at a time  
  
[Chorus]  
One foot in front of the other  
Take one step then take another  
Keep on walkin', we're headed in the right direction

Hittin' our stride, one foot in front of the other  
  
What's down the road we can't say  
And the road behind don't matter  
But every mile along the way  
Is just another mile together  
Unconcerned about the twists and turns  
We're takin' it nice and slow  
Safe and sound, covering ground  
Steady as she goes

Gordon Lightfoot,A Lesson In Love,"""Nothing is for certain""  
That's what the showman said  
First you must open the curtain  
And stand 'em on their heads  
There can be no inhibitions  
No prima donna ways  
If you want to pass the audition  
And times is tough these days  
Remember when Mr. Barnum  
Presented Jenny Lind  
They named a candy after her  
A circus after him  
End of my story  
The rest is history  
She in all of her glory  
He lived quietly  
He needed her, she needed him  
As sure as the skies above  
In a way it was for them  
A lesson in love, a lesson in love  
You look like the moon glow  
That follows me home  
Always makes me turn around  
Won't leave me alone  
First to come are the midgets  
A monkey and a kid  
Followed by those two one-armed jugglers  
The ego and the id  
Songs of the season  
Apples of the sun  
There is no rhyme or reason  
Just a time for each and every one  
Hang on Mr. Barnum  
Hang on Jenny Lind  
We will meet you in streets of gold  
Where eternity begins  
We will let it all hangout  
Go hand in glove  
Life was meant to live and learn  
A lesson in love, a lesson in love

Gordon Lightfoot,A Passing Ship,"A passing ship  
I have found the open ocean  
Give me no lip  
The waves roll by as I pass on  
A sunlit sea  
On the first day of April  
How fresh the wind  
Will you miss me when I'm gone?  
How many words  
How many songs still unwritten?  
How many ships  
Of the line have come and gone?  
In the good old days  
May they never be forgotten  
They had heavy wind  
Or they had no wind at all  
A passing ship  
It is midnight on the ocean  
Had a real long trip  
I have been at sea all winter  
When my ship came in  
I was givin' up the ghost  
I think I should be  
Leavin' those passing ships alone  
When the sea runs high  
The sea runs wild and I'm unsteady  
And I think of you  
In the warmth of your home and family  
When love is true  
There is no truer occupation  
And may this gale  
Blow us to the ones we love  
Another day, another ocean  
Give me no lip

Love alone will keep me breathing all through the night  
In that quiet place where dreams abide  
You and I together are a bit of all right  
Feeling good is how we whish to be  
  
Always on the bright side  
Always out of sight  
Nesting like two eagles in the trees  
  
Always on the bright side  
Keeps it kind of light  
That girl gets friendlier each day  
  
Always on the bright side  
Always out of sight  
Nesting like two eagles in the trees"
Gordon Lightfoot,Anything For Love,"In my life  
In my time and in each line I've ever sung  
And in my life  
Was it my imagination or are you still the one  
Who lingers on  
I'd do anything for you  
You'd do anything for me  
We'd do anything for love  
Ohh, you'd use any means  
And I would try any scheme for love  
We'd do anything for love  
Once or twice  
In my loneliness I watched the world go by  
There was I  
One too many miles beyond where you might say  
Some luck was due, after all  
We could have touched the sky  
You had no alibi because  
We'd do anything for love  
Ohh, I would try any means  
To have you in all my dreams because  
You'd do anything for love  
Not long ago as I remember  
Once upon a dark and windy day  
When love looked like a dying ember  
Before you came to call  
The beauty of it all, I though I'd lost and yet  
'Cause in my life  
There in my mind in it now shines  
A guiding light  
Never again will I lose my way  
Ohh, I would not tell a lie and  
You had no alibi because  
We'd do anything for love  
Ohh, you'd use any means  
And I would try any scheme for love  
Simply anything for love  
Ohh, I would do anything  
Just about anything because  
We'd do anything for love  
Anything for love  
Anything for love  
Anything for love

Gordon Lightfoot,Baby Step Back,"Now it looks to me like the same old place  
In the sky it looks like rain

And the one wish that remains  
  
Baby step back baby step back  
Either step up or step back  
  
No you know I don't write no bad checks  
I have no wish to repent  
I've seen a few

I don't cause no accidents  
Whiskey and wine help me pass the time  
I don't leave no evidence  
  
Baby step back baby step back  
Either step up or step back

So you'd best leave me alone  
Maybe I'll get much more than I need  
Or much less than I should own  
Last of all let me say it again  
Either step up or step on  
  
Baby step back baby step back

Gordon Lightfoot,Ballad Of Yarmouth Castle,"Well, it's four o'clock in the afternoon  
And the anchors have been weighed  
From Miami to Nassau  
She's bound across the waves  
She'll be headin' south through Biscayne Bay  
Into the open sea  
Yarmouth Castle, she's a-dyin' and don't know it  
Now the many years she's been to sea  
She's seen the better times  
She gives a groan of protest  
As they cast away her lines  
And the grumble of her engines  
And the rust along her spine  
Tells the Castle she's too old to be sailin'  
But the sands run out within her heart  
A tiny spark glows red  
It smolders through the evening  
There's laughter overhead  
Now the dinner's served and the cards are dealt  
And the drinks are passed around  
Deep within the fire starts a-burnin'  
Now it's midnight on the open sea  
And the moon is shinin' bright  
Some people join the party  
And others say goodnight  
There's many who are sleepin' now  
It's been a busy day  
And a tiny wisp of smoke is a-risin'  
""Oh Lord,"" she groans, ""I'm burning  
Let someone understand""  
But her silent plea is wasted  
In the playin' of the band  
Everybody's dancin' on her deck  
And they're havin' such a time  
And a voice says, ""Shut up and deal, I'm losin'""  
Deep within the Yarmouth Castle  
The fire begins to glow  
It leaps into the hallways  
And climbs and twists and grows  
And the paint she wore to keep her young  
Oh Lord, how well it burns  
And soon that old fire is a-ragin'  
Up beneath the bridge it's climbin' fast  
The captain stands aloft  
He calls up to the boatswain, says  
""Boatswain, we are lost""  
For the ragged hoses in the racks  
No pressure do they hold  
And the people down below will soon be dyin'  
All amidships, oh she's blazin' now  
It's spreadin' fore and aft  
The people are a-scramblin'  
As the fire blocks their path  
The evil smoke surrounds them  
And they're fallin' in their tracks  
And the captain in his lifeboat is a-leavin'  
Oh then the ship, Bahama Star  
Comes steamin' through the night  
She sees the Castle blazin'  
And 'tis a terrible sight  
""Jump down, jump down"", the captain cries  
""We'll save you if we can""  
Then the paint on his funnels is a-fryin'  
""God help the ones who sleep below  
And cannot find the way  
Thank God for those we rescue  
Upon this awful day""  
Now the heroes, they are many  
But the times are growin' slim  
And now from stern to bow, she's a-blazin'  
Oh the Yarmouth Castle's moanin'  
She's cryin' like a child  
You can hear her if you listen  
Above the roar so wild  
Is she cryin' for the ones who lie  
Within her molten sides?  
Or cryin' for herself, I'm a-wonderin'  
But the livin' soon were rescued  
The ones who lived to tell  
From the Star they watched her  
As she died there in the swells  
Like a toy ship on a mill pond  
She burned all through the night  
Then slipped beneath the waves in the mornin'

Gordon Lightfoot,Beautiful,"At times I just don't know  
How you could be anything but beautiful  
I think that I was made for you  
And you were made for me  
  
And I know that I won't ever change  
We've been friends through rain or shine  
For such a long, long time  
  
Laughing eyes and smiling face  
It seems so lucky just to have the right  
Of telling you with all my might  
You're beautiful tonight  
  
And I know that you won't ever stray  
Cause you've been that way from day to day  
For such a long, long time

I'm telling you, that you're beautiful.

Gordon Lightfoot,Bitter Green,"Upon the Bitter Green she walked the hills above the town  
Echoed to her footsteps as soft as eiderdown  
Waiting for her master to kiss away her tears  
Waiting through the years  
  
[Chorus]  
Bitter Green they called her walking in the sun  
Loving everyone that she met  
Bitter Green they called her waiting in the sun  
Waiting for someone to take her home  
  
Some say he was a sailor who died away at sea  
Some say he was a prisoner who never was set free  
Lost upon the ocean he died there in the mist  
Dreaming of a kiss  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But now the Bitter Green is gone the hills have turned to rust  
There comes a weary stranger whose tears fall in the dust  
Kneeling by the churchyard in the autumn mist  
Dreaming of a kiss

Gordon Lightfoot,Black Day In July,"Black day in July  
Motor city madness has touched the countryside

The doors are quickly bolted  
And the children locked inside  
  
Black day in July  
Black day in July

The deed is done the troops are sent  
There's really not much choice you see

To patch things up as best they can  
There is no time to hesitate  
The speech is made the dues can wait

Black day in July  
The streets of Motor City now are quiet and serene

Black day in July  
Black day in July  
Motor city madness has touched the countryside  
And through the smoke and cinders  
You can hear it far and wide  
The doors are quickly bolted  
And the children locked inside"
Gordon Lightfoot,Blackberry Wine,"There's a south wind risin' and  
The moon shines on my window sill  
I've got a feeling I might walk on over the hill  
I'm bent but not broken, all I need is some rest  
And a bottle of your very best  
Blackberry wine  
  
There's a new moon risin' and  
The wind sings its old song  
Pass it on over it's a sin to be sober too long  
I'm bent but not broken, all I need is my share  
Of a bottle of that very rare  
Blackberry wine  
  
My old gal's got a new dress on five and dime  
Try as she will she can't get me  
To come home on time  
But I'd never cheat her  
Or mistreat her you know  
As over the mountain I go  
Blackberry wine  
  
I'll be soft spoken  
All I need is my rest  
And a bottle of your very best  
Blackberry wine  
  
Now my days are numbered  
And one more heel's been killed  
Blackberry John left me  
His old recipe in his will  
I'm bent but not broken,  
All I need is some time  
And a bottle of your very fine  
Blackberry wine  
  
Blackberry wine,  
You know that I'm quite dry without you

Gordon Lightfoot,Brave Mountaineers,"Born in the country and I like that country smile  
Of the little girls and boys, they remind me of a child  
That I knew and a big harvest moon  
That shon' by suppertime in the dusty afternoon  
  
And I need to be there  
When the autumn wind goes whistlin' through the trestle we would climb  
Like brave mountaineers  
We never were much bothered by time  
  
Born in the country and I like that country song  
We played for just a nickel every time we got to town  
And I bought you a dime diamond ring  
In the hayloft we would play, we were princesses and kings  
  
And I need to be there  
When the world gets too heavy and the shadows cross my mind  
Like brave mountaineers  
We never were much bothered by time  
  
Born in the country and I like that country way  
Of the uncles and the cousins and the card games they would play

Gordon Lightfoot,Cabaret,"All I can see is the sea and the sky  
And the sky is blue and the sea is green  
Yesterday's a cabaret  
Gowns of satin on ladies gay  
Yesterday's a cabaret  
Sounds of laughter on faces gray  
Yesterday's a carousel  
Catch the ring and all will be well  
From the coast of California  
Up to the Oregon border  
I've thumbed a thousand miles I guess  
Sitting in a roadside diner  
The big trucks rollin' by  
I don't seem to know at times what's best  
And still I'd like to tell her  
That I miss her so, in north Ontario  
If you're drivin' east to Reno  
Or north to Mendocino  
I hope you find your rainbow?s end  
This highway is my rainbow  
And though I might regret it  
I'm so glad I said it way back when  
And still I'd like to tell her  
That I miss her so, in north Ontario

Gordon Lightfoot,Canadian Railroad Trilogy,"There was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run  
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun  
Long before the white man and long before the wheel  
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real  
  
But time has no beginnings and hist'ry has no bounds  
As to this verdant country they came from all around  
They sailed upon her waterways and they walked the forests tall  
And they built the mines the mills and the factories for the good of us  
All  
  
And when the young man's fancy was turnin' to the spring  
The railroad men grew restless for to hear the hammers ring  
Their minds were overflowing with the visions of their day  
And many a fortune lost and won and many a debt to pay  
  
For they looked in the future and what did they see  
They saw an iron road runnin' from sea to the sea  
Bringin' the goods to a young growin' land  
All up through the seaports and into their hands  
  
Look away said they across this mighty land  
From the eastern shore to the western strand  
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails  
We gotta lay down the tracks and tear up the trails  
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow  
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow  
  
Bring in the workers and bring up the rails  
We're gonna lay down the tracks and tear up the trails  
Open 'er heart let the life blood flow  
Gotta get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow  
Get on our way 'cause we're movin' too slow  
  
Behind the blue Rockies the sun is declinin'  
The stars, they come stealin' at the close of the day  
Across the wide prairie our loved ones lie sleeping  
Beyond the dark oceans in a place far away  
  
We are the navvies who work upon the railway  
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun  
Livin' on stew and drinkin' bad whiskey  
Bendin' our old backs 'til the long days are done  
  
We are the navvies who work upon the railway  
Swingin' our hammers in the bright blazin' sun  
Layin' down track and buildin' the bridges  
Bendin' our old backs 'til the railroad is done  
  
So over the mountains and over the plains  
Into the muskeg and into the rain  
Up the St. Lawrence all the way to Gaspe  
Swingin' our hammers and drawin' our pay  
Drivin' 'em in and tyin' 'em down  
Away to the bunkhouse and into the town  
A dollar a day and a place for my head  
A drink to the livin' and a toast to the dead  
  
Oh the song of the future has been sung  
All the battles have been won  
O'er the mountain tops we stand  
All the world at our command  
We have opened up the soil  
With our teardrops and our toil  
  
For there was a time in this fair land when the railroad did not run  
When the wild majestic mountains stood alone against the sun  
Long before the white man and long before the wheel  
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real  
When the green dark forest was too silent to be real  
And many are the dead men too silent to be real.

Gordon Lightfoot,Clouds Of Loneliness,"What can you do? You'll never win  
Where will you go when night closes in?  
Where will it lead? Will it ever end?  
Where will it stop?  
Losing a friend isn't what we had in mind exactly  
All we need is a friend I guess  
With my midnight star to guide through  
Clouds of loneliness  
You knew someone but was it love?  
So many years, push came to shove  
You had a dream, so they had one too  
You turned away, they were untrue  
In our early days we were too willing  
At the time we had yet to arrive  
Many a man and a woman found  
Trying to stay alive  
Where will you go? What will you do  
When your whole world ain't talking to you?  
Maybe you think you will see the light  
Baby, it's time you hope it's right  
And I'm all dressed up to be somebody  
All I need is a friendly face  
With my midnight crowd to glide through  
Clouds of empty space  
Seems like every time we turn around  
What we see could be anyone's guess  
Many a man and a woman found in  
Clouds of loneliness

Gordon Lightfoot,Don't Beat Me Down,"Oh, when he was a man, my father would stand  
I never saw him run  
There wasn't anyone could make the man bend

Till the powers that be to a liking to him

At the cradle she bought  
For the little tot she held to her breast  
And the song that she sang was an anthem to love  
It was all that I heard

Gordon Lightfoot,Endless Wire,"I ain't got nothin' to hide  
My mind is an endless wire  
I got both feet on the ground  
I ain't got no one for hire  
I ain't got a thing to show  
My lines have all expired  
So don't go foolin' around  
And set my wheels afire  
Down in the dark of a burnt out soul  
There's a few good second hand dreams  
Deep in the dark of a heavenly night with you  
Down in the black of a bottomless hole  
There's a few good second hand scenes  
Deep in the dark of the heavenly blue  
Where the sea runs green  
I ain't got nothin' to give  
My life is an endless climb  
My love's a paperback dream  
I don't have nothin' but time  
I ain't got a thing to show  
I don't know my own name

Deep in the dark of a heavenly night with you  
Down in the black of a bottomless hole  
There's a few good second hand scenes

Gordon Lightfoot,Forgive Me Lord,"Make my world a better place to be  
Remove these chains and set me free  
Give my life one reason to begin  
Forgive me Lord for I have sinned  
  
Take my hand and lead me as you choose  
It seems we ain't got much to lose  
Give this place one season without shame  
Forgive me Lord I've sinned again  
  
I been down on my luck, as a matter of fact  
I've even been chaste  
Drifting along, singing a song  
For the whole human race  
I been caught in the act, as a matter of fact  
I'm even well known  
Floating on by with a laugh and a sigh  
On the road that leads home  
I got no more time left to roam, if you love me  
  
Take this world and build it as you please  
With a little help from the likes of me  
Keep it safe from harm and make it pure  
Forgive the rich and save the poor  
  
Like the dust on the wind I've been taken again by my foolish pride  
Drifting along, singing a song, that's how I get by  
I been caught in the act, as a matter of fact I've even been chased  
Floating on by with a laugh and a sigh for the whole human race  
I got no more time left to waste, if you love me  
  
Make my world a better place to be  
Remove these chains and set me free  
Give my face a different point of view  
Forgive us Lord if we run to you  
  
If you love me  
Make my world a better place to be  
Remove these chains and set me free  
Give my life one reason to begin

Gordon Lightfoot,Go Go Round,"Alone upon the sidewalks of despair, 'twas there she wandered with her
suitcase in her hand.  
Her fate she pondered, only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care.  
She met him on a night so rare when her friends were there and the band was
grooving.  
When he gave a glance that said how much he would like to meet her,  
How was she to know at the time he would mistreat her?  
  
In her case she danced for him although a hundred eyes were turned her way,  
And before the set was through he knew she would be his loved one.  
Only a go-go girl in love with someone who didn't care,  
Only twenty-one, she was a young girl just in from somewhere.  
  
He's playing up in Michigan with a group they call The Intended,  
With a kiss, and a promise, he was gone, the song was ended.  
But as she walks, she waits for him, the pavement is a shoulder for her tears,  
But in her heart, she knows there is no way she can hope to change him.

Gordon Lightfoot,Hi'way Songs,"When I walk the hill so high  
Around the town where I was born  
New York seems so far away  
Though I was there just yesterday  
I have played on my guitar  
In coffeehouses, hall and bars  
Everyone that I call friend  
Knows they will not be forgot  
Trains and planes and rented cars  
Singers, saints and other starts  
I suspect them every one  
They'll never change, it's too much fun  
Just for now I'd like to rest  
In the shade of a maple tree  
To the blue Canadian sky  
I'll say a prayer for the world out there  
When I stand on my own sod  
It feels so good to be home, by God  
The winter wind has turned my head  
But I always came up warm somehow  
Bottles, beads and cigarettes  
And lovers that I ain't found yet  
Pickin' with a friend till dawn  
And singing all of those hi'way songs  
Just for now I'd like to rest  
In the shade of a maple tree  
To the blue Canadian sky  
I'll say a prayer for the world out there  
When I walk the hill so high  
Around the town where I was born  
New York seems so far away  
Though I was there just yesterday  
I would travel all my life  
If loneliness was not the price  
While headin' north across that line's  
The only time I'm flyin'

Gordon Lightfoot,If I Could,"If I could sing like the poets and kings of this world  
If I could rise like the wind or the tides of the sea  
I would sing you to sleep my love with sweet melody  
And let you dream away till the morning light returned again  
To take you away from me  
If I could speak with the tongues of the masters of old  
If I could tame all the fleeting perceptions I hold  
Would I stand in the marketplace before  
To be shouted down without any warning at all, to be stood by the wall  
And shot by the man in blue  
If I could run with the grace of a sun-colored stallion  
If I could fly like the great silver jets in the morning  
If I caused the wind to change with one wave of my hand  
And if I could play the final symphony and set it free  
Would it mean anything to you  
If I could stand like a rusty old man in his armor  
If I could ride the steed that he rode in his time  
I would turn his head away to the river  
And let him wander through the meadow grass, wild and free  
For everyone to see  
If I could sing like the poets and kings of this world

Gordon Lightfoot,If You Could Read My Mind,"If you could read my mind love,  
What a tale my thoughts could tell.  
Just like an old time movie,  
'Bout a ghost from a wishing well.  
In a castle dark or a fortress strong  
With chains upon my feet.  
You know that ghost is me.  
And I will never be set free,  
As long as I'm a ghost that you can't see.

The kind the drugstores sell.  
When you reach the part where the heartaches come,  
the hero would be me.  
Heroes often fail.  
And you won't read that book again  
Because the ending's just too hard to take.  
  
I walk away like a movie star  
Who gets burned in a three way script.  
Enter number two,  
A movie queen to play the scene  
Of bringing all the good things out in me,  
But for now love lets be real.  
  
I never thought I could act this way  
And I've got to say that I just don't get it.  
I don't know where we went wrong  
But the feelings gone and I just can't get it back.

Gordon Lightfoot,If You Need Me,"If you want to know the reasons for  
The things I feel inside  
You can run away and hide if you want to

Show me a way to get through

If you want to know for certain  
What is written in my soul

Like an endless stream  
If you need me  
Show me a way to walk tall

Until I met you  
  
Sun lights up the seasons  
Blue eyes light up the night  
  
If you want to know the meaning of

Gordon Lightfoot,I'll Be Alright,"I'll be alright I'll be alright if I don't have to smile  
If I don't to face the morning sunrise for a while  
I'll get along you know I'll take tomorrow with a grin  
If I never have to think about her love again  
  
And I won't mind if words are spoken  
In empty love songs as long as I don't have to hear  
I'll be alright if I don't have to face the world again  
And if I never love again I'll be alright  
  
Last night she gave the final word, she said her last goodbye  
And disappeared forever in the world outside  
One kiss and then she took her leave to go I know not where  
Into the misty shadows of the midnight air  
  
But I won't mind if words are spoken

Gordon Lightfoot,I'll Do Anything,"Down in the warm dark part of my heart you stay  
I've been on my own for so long as I stand here today  
I'd never leave you, I'll do anything that you say

But my love for you was too deep for my eyes to see

Gordon Lightfoot,In A Windowpane,"I looked into a windowpane  
Last evening in a city far away  
I was feelin' sad and blue  
I wondered then if I should really stay  
Wanting someone to be with me in the light of this uncertain time  
Waiting by the window for the man inside  
To please make up his mind  
Will you be one who passed through but never saw  
Never knowing never feeling anything  
Will you live your whole life through never knowing what to do  
Will you be one who passed through but never saw  
I walked along the roadway to a fountain  
Where lovers come to meet  
A hobo walked up to me, I could tell  
He didn't have enough to eat  
He said, ""good sir you look so kind  
And though the years have stripped me to the bone  
It seems I am the better man  
For in this place I've never walked alone

Telephone ain't givin' out no calls  
And when the seasons come to haunt you  
Will you still find springtime in the fall  
And when you're on your island

And will you feed a hungry man

Gordon Lightfoot,In The Early Mornin' Rain,"In the early mornin' rain  
With a dollar in my hand  
And an achin' in my heart  
And my pockets full of sand  
  
I'm a long way from home  
And I miss my loved one so  
In the early mornin' rain  
With no place to go  
  
Out on runway number nine  
Big 707 set to roll  
But I'm stuck here on the ground  
Where the pavement never grows  
  
The liquor tasted good  
And the women all were fast  
Well there she goes, my friend  
She's movin' out at last  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar  
See the silver wings on high  
She's away and westward bound  
High above the clouds she'll fly  
  
Where the mornin' rain don't fall  
And the sun always shines.  
She'll be flyin' o'er my home  
In about three hours time.  
  
This old airport's got me down  
Ain't no earthly good to me  
'Cause I'm stuck here on the ground  
Cold and drunk as I might be

The way you can a freight train  
So I'll just be on my way

Gordon Lightfoot,Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,"When you're lost in the rain in juarez and it's eastertime too,  
And your gravity fails and negativity don't pull you through,  
Don't put on any airs when you're down on rue morgue avenue,  
They got some hungry women there and they really make a mess outa you!  
  
Sweet melinda, the peasants call her the goddess of doom,  
She speaks good english and she invites you up into her room.  
And you're so kind, too careful not to go to her too soon,  
Then she steals your voice and leaves you howling at the moon!  
  
Up on housing project hill it's either fortune or fame,  
You must pick one or the other though neither of them is what they claim,  
If you're lookin' to get silly you'd better go back to from where you came,  
Because the cops don't need you and man they expect the same!  
  
I started out on burgundy but soon hit the harder stuff,  
Everybody said they'd stand behind me when the game got rough,  
But the joke was on me - there was nobody there to even call my bluff,  
I'm going back to new york city I do believe I've had enough,

Gordon Lightfoot,Knotty Pine,"She's my knotty pine  
She leans with the wind  
She cries turpentine  
Sometimes she nettles me  
But I don't mind  
Only now and then  
When her branches lean beneath the snow  
She's knotty but nice  
Reaching for the sky  
She don't like snow 'n ice  
To leave things as they stand  
Is my advice  
She's been good to me  
So I tend to go there when I can  
She's my knotty pine  
Such a pretty scene  
She tries to be kind  
She gives birds a home  
And shelters them  
In her coat of green  
She's as green as evergreen can be  
She's a real delight  
When little breezes call  
To ruffle up her skin  
All her sap runs free  
And sticks to me  
Hidden deep within  
I will be her slave eternally  
She's my knotty pine  
She leans with the wind  
She crys turpentine  
Sometimes she nettles me  
But I don't mind  
Only now and then  
When her branches lean beneath the snow  

","She's my knotty pine  
She leans with the wind  
She cries turpentine  
Sometimes she nettles me  
But I don't mind  
Only now and then  
When her branches lean beneath the snow  
She's knotty but nice  
Reaching for the sky  
She don't like snow 'n ice  
To leave things as they stand  
Is my advice  
She's been good to me  
So I tend to go there when I can  
She's my knotty pine  
Such a pretty scene  
She tries to be kind  
She gives birds a home  
And shelters them  
In her coat of green  
She's as green as evergreen can be  
She's a real delight  
When little breezes call  
To ruffle up her skin  
All her sap runs free  
And sticks to me  
Hidden deep within  
I will be her slave eternally  
She's my knotty pine  
She leans with the wind  
She crys turpentine  
Sometimes she nettles me  
But I don't mind  
Only now and then  
When her branches lean beneath the snow"
Gordon Lightfoot,Lazy Mornin',"Another lazy mornin', no need to get down on anyone  
My son, coffee's in the kitchen, woman on the run  
No need to get bothered, I'll think about Monday  
When Monday comes, it's two for one  
Mister Hoot 'n Holler, gotta make a dollar  
Another lazy mornin', I took time to make town 'n stock a pint or two  
The most delicious brew  
Keepin' up with the joneses, I hope no one telephones us  
I'd take a place in the country, but for now the old back yard  
Looks to me like fifty acres of the roundest ground in town  
Another lazy mornin', come supper time I'm gonna light my barbecue  
Nothin' new, only that she loves me  
And nothin' I know can change me, no need to get bothered  
I do more livin' than it might seem  
Some dream, livin' like a pauper, bless my darlin' daughter  
I'd like to know what makes a man go, over land and sea  
I guess it must get kinda lonesome, that's the way I used to be  
Another lazy mornin', no need to get down on anyone  
Such fun, coffee's in the kitchen, woman on the run

Gordon Lightfoot,Leaves Of Grass,"The leaves of grass will not pass on  
Though the millstones grind them into dust  
For the earth shall give new life to them  
But only the grass will grow once more  
And the brave must fall to honor the names  
Of the ones who have gone before  
And the earth shall give new life to them  
But only the grass will grow once more  
If people could look into each other's eyes  
What a wonderful place this world would be  
All strife would end, we could start again  
And dreams like these must not pass on  
But the brave keep falling to honor the names  
Of the ones who have gone before

Gordon Lightfoot,Let It Ride,"These are just the simple facts, I will relate to you  
Though they are not connected, each and every one is true  
If they seem a bit untidy, well, unraveling them is fun  
I will not stand corrected, I have not harmed anyone  
I just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leavin' on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
Better I listen to my heart, I sometimes fail to find  
One sane and simple answer on the bright side of my mind  
Even when I'm sleeping, I can't seem to unwind  
I just let it ride  
I knew a man from Windsor who went to Detroit every night  
And stateside of the tunnel customs agents gave him flight  
He threw his stash in the river and his bedroll on the ground  
And when they finally got there, a sleeping man was all that they found  
He just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leave on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
Hear the steeple bell ring out above my lobster pots  
I might be out here fishin' man but that ain't where it stops  
The mouths I feed are many and they all say thanks a lot  
They just let it ride  
One day when I'm old and gray an' consider what's gone by  
I always will be proud of every tear I've ever cried  
And all of the old jokes we told around the candle light  
To all those tender damsels who had helped us in the night  
They just let it ride  
Ride, let it ride  
Leavin' on the evenin' tide  
Just let it ride  
I'm gonna let it ride  
Here's to the girls from London and the ones from Montreal  
We never will forget them, we still fantasize them all  
I knew one in St. Louis on a Missouri afternoon  
I met one up in Shanghai and another in Rangoon  
I just let it ride

Gordon Lightfoot,Long River,"Where the long river flows

By my window  
  
There's a tiny bird that calls

Gordon Lightfoot,Long Thin Dawn,"That long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
I've seen the hills of Frisco and the streets of Montreal  
In every town I've been to I've had someone to call  
From Winnipeg to Edmonton, Vancouver to St. Paul  
I've had so many good friends I couldn't miss them all  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
Last night I came to Denver beneath the snowcapped ridge  
I thought about my darling as I stood beneath the bridge  
And there were times I made her cry but I guess by now she's learned  
That any time I've wandered I always have returned  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
Right now I'm on a highway just east of Omaha  
Riding shotgun on the biggest rig you ever saw  
With forty tons of pig iron and a trucker known as Bill  
All the way to Windsor, we've got some miles to kill  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
While climbing up a hillside, Bill drops her down a gear  
And the engine sings so sweetly 'tis music to my ear  
I tell him how I long to be just like him if I can  
Driving like the restless wind across this precious land  
In that long thin dawn, that long thin dawn is coming on again  
Says Bill, ""The air is clean tonight"", as he puffs a big cigar  
""And if this rig keeps rolling, my boy you'll travel far  
But when you are a trucker you'll come to realize  
The only thing a man can do is watch the world go by""

Gordon Lightfoot,Long Way Back Home,"From the railhead to the boatyard  
From the factory to the farm  
From the mine to the mill yard  
I've weathered the storm  
From the bar room to the bedpost  
I've wasted my days, all I have is my drink  
And the time left to think  
While time slips away  
Just look at my face  
When you tell me goodbye  
You'll see what I'm after  
By the look in my eye  
Just walk away and leave me alone  
It's a long way back home  
Now in case you should ask me  
What it is that I've done  
I'd say I'm a soldier  
Who once had a son  
But my son doesn't know me  
That's his right to choose  
Oh say, can you see? My best friend is me  
I'm a friend I could use  
Just look at my face  
When you tell me goodbye  
You'll see what I'm after  
By the look in my eye  
Just walk away and leave me alone  
It's a long way back home  
Now the pages have faded  
The story grows cold  
And the plot falls to ashes  
Like the ruins of old  
Those rats in my rafters  
They're after my shoes  
And anything else they can find on the shelf

I pulled my harpoon out my dirty red bandanna  
I's playin' soft while Bobby sang the blues  
Winsheild wipers slappin' time

Gordon Lightfoot,Miguel,"Never had much to say, he traveled alone with no friends  
Like a shadowy ghost at dawn he came and he went  
Through the woodland swiftly gliding, to the young maid he came gliding  
Where she'd run to meet him, by the garden wall  
Oh my sweet Miguel, I will never tell  
No one will ever know, what I know too well  
And he'd smile and lay his head on her breast and he'd say I have no fear  
They're waiting for me to cross the border, to swim the river  
'Cause I've done that before  
To see my true loves smiling face  
A hundred times or more  
Oh my sweet Miguel she cried  
I'll love you till I die  
He was born to the south in Mexico they say  
The child of a man who had soon gone away  
But his mother loved him dearly and she would take him yearly  
To the great Cathedral in St. Augustine  
Oh my young Miguel, listen to the bell  
Of my poverty you must never tell  
And he cried himself to sleep in the night  
And he vowed to make things right  
So he took the gun down from the wall and he paid a call  
He knew she'd understand  
A lawman came to capture him  
The gun jumped in his hand  
Oh Miguel the mother cried  
You must run son or you'll die  
So the story is told of his true love cross the line  
As strong as the oak and as sweet as the vine  
And the child she bore him, came on the fateful mornin'  
When they sent him to his final rest  
Oh my sweet Miguel listen to the bell  
No one will ever know, of what I know too well  
Then she'd smile and lay the child on her breast  
And she'd say I have no fear

Gordon Lightfoot,Mother Of A Miner's Child,"She is my flower  
And she blooms for the one who loves her best  
The miners stop to watch her when she walks  
They know her love is not for sale  
She will never fail me 'cause I know  
I watch her grow  
And the mother of a miner's child  
Waits for me beside the kitchen door  
She is my light  
In this place where the darkness never ends  
She'll guide me where the tunnels twist and bend  
She's the only one who listens when I tell her  
I got less than I can spend  
She knows the pace  
Oh mother of a miner's child  
Wash away the coal dust from my face  
When the night shift's done  
She'll be waiting by the table when I come  
Searchin' for another dream to chase  
Oh a mother of a miner's child  
I know that you still think about the day  
When we'll be movin' on  
Remember dear ole daddy and  
The promise that I made to carry on  
Sometimes I smile  
In the cage where the cables softly hum  
I'd curse that old straw boss to the bone  
But the mother of a miner's child  
Is waiting for her paycheck to come home  
Come Saturday  
And he is just a miner's boy  
I hope that he will find a better way  
She is my flower  
And she blooms for the one who loves her best  
The miners stop to watch her when she walks

Gordon Lightfoot,Mountains And Marian,"All is well  
I've made my peace where highways never end  
Yesterday's a memory today is just a friend  
For the mountains and Marian are calling me again  
And the red pines will bow their heads  
The rivers and the watersheds will swallow up my tears  
All is well  
I left the cold midwestern towns behind  
There's a semi up the road ahead I'll take him in my time  
For the hot-blooded mountain love is calling me again  
And the vagabond within me cries  
The wind and rain might burn my eyes but I won't feel the pain  
For the mountains and Marian will greet me there as only she can do  
  
All is well  
As I swing up to the border bent for hell  
And the service station man agreed I didn't look too well  
But the mountains and Marian are calling out to me  
And I got my bedroll on my back  
And everything that I could pack to see me on my way  
  
All is well  
I've made my peace and man, I'm feelin' fine  
And the losers that I left behind I'll think about some other time  
For the border men were all my friends they couldn't find a dime  
And the prairie towns go sailing by  
Saskatchewan there's mud in your eye I'm leavin' you behind  
There'll be hot-blooded mountain love to satisfy my soul  
And the red pines will bow their heads  
The rivers and the watersheds will carry us along  
And the mountains and Marian will greet me there as only she can do  
  
All is well  
The foothills are coming into sight  
Today is just a memory the future is tonight  
And the red pines will bow their heads  
The rivers and the watersheds will carry us along

Gordon Lightfoot,Movin',"Everybody's movin', movin' across the town,  
The skyline grows and the cut of the clothes,  
Is enough to turn you around.  
Oh, oh the future is just an hour away,  
And the hearts of youth are aflame,  
Everybody's movin', nothin' stays the same!  
Fields are turnin', the bridges are burnin',  
And the light turns night into day.  
It's the time to stake it or make it or break it,  
For the time flies quickly away.  
Oh, oh it's the time to start makin' your mark,  
And it's the time to get in the game!  
Everybody's movin', nothin' stays the same!  
  
Upwards, outwards, all around,  
They're reachin' for the sky.  
The ribbons of highway and roads of steel,  
It's a time to be alive!  
Oh, oh, ain't no ragin' river that we can't cross,  
Nor giant too tall to be slain,  
Everybody's movin', nothin' stays the same!

Gordon Lightfoot,Much To My Surprise,"I saw two dreamers dreamin'  
They almost caused a spark  
I saw two lovers in paradise right back at the start  
I saw two minds in the world set free  
But it almost broke my heart  
Isn't it strange to be right now havin' you close to me?  
Much to my surprise  
I saw two schemes schemin'  
They almost caused a lark  
They were two brave souls on a wild blue spree  
Right back at the park  
They were like two ships  
And they sailed right by each other in the dark  
Wouldn't ya like to be right now  
Out where the actors play?  
So much for your disguise  
I saw two souls out searchin'  
They said their last goodbyes  
And I saw two hearts of passion then  
Much to my surprise  
I saw two hearts on passion bent  
The kind which mystifies  
It is so strange to be right now  
Having you on my knee  
Much to my surprise  
I gotta make you see somehow  
I saw two minds that wandered  
They almost caused a wreck  
They were all checked out for a wild blue sea  
When someone cried hit the deck  
I saw two minds in the world set wise  
But I almost broke my specs  
Wouldn't ya like to be right now

Gordon Lightfoot,On The High Seas,"Was it someone she met that's so hard to forget  
Was it some kind of an ocean of changes  
I don't remember where she said she would be  
And since I don't know, let me guess  
Was it somewhere in Michigan or the Lake of the Woods  
Up in old Montreal or Toronto the good  
Somewhere in Reno or somewhere in Rome  
And when all is said and done  
Will she leave me alone  
  
I don't want to get so low  
And as for my sadness, it comes and it goes  
I don't remember where she said she would be  
Back in the city or on the high seas  
  
Was it up in Hornpayne where the trains run on time  
Was she drinking champagne when she made up her mind  
North of the border or down in South Bend  
And when all is said and done  
Is there no rainbow's end  
  
I don't want to own the key  
To some ghostly mansion where souls are set free  
I don't remember where she said she would go  
Straight for the highway or down the low road  
I don't remember where she said she would be  
Back in the city or on the high seas

Gordon Lightfoot,"Pussywillows, Cattails","Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
Rainbows in the woodland, water to my knees  
Shivering, quivering, the warm breath of spring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Catbirds and cornfields, daydreams together  
Riding on the roadside the dust gets in your eyes  
Reveling, disheveling, the summer nights can bring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Slanted rays and colored days, stark blue horizons  
Naked limbs and wheat bins, hazy afternoons  
Voicing, rejoicing, the wine cups do bring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Harsh nights and candlelights, woodfires a-blazin'  
Soft lips and fingertips resting in my soul  
Treasuring, remembering, the promise of spring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses

","Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
Rainbows in the woodland, water to my knees  
Shivering, quivering, the warm breath of spring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Catbirds and cornfields, daydreams together  
Riding on the roadside the dust gets in your eyes  
Reveling, disheveling, the summer nights can bring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Slanted rays and colored days, stark blue horizons  
Naked limbs and wheat bins, hazy afternoons  
Voicing, rejoicing, the wine cups do bring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses  
  
Harsh nights and candlelights, woodfires a-blazin'  
Soft lips and fingertips resting in my soul  
Treasuring, remembering, the promise of spring  
Pussywillows, cat-tails, soft winds and roses"
Gordon Lightfoot,Ribbon Of Darkness,"Ribbon of darkness over me  
Since my true love walked out the door  
Tears I never had before  
Ribbon of darkness over me  
  
Clouds a-atherin' o'er my head  
That kill the day and hide the sun  
That shroud the night when day is done  
Ribbon of darkness over me  
  
Rain is falling on the meadow  
Where once my love and I did lie  
Now she is gone from the meadow  
My love goodbye  
  
Ribbon of darkness over me  
Where once the world was young as spring  
Where flowers did bloom and birds did sing  
Ribbon of darkness over me  
  
Here in this cold room lyin'  
Don't want to see no one but you  
Lord I wish I could be dyin'  
To forget you  
  
Oh how I wish your heart could see  
How mine just aches and breaks all day  
Come on home and take away  
This ribbon of darkness over me

Gordon Lightfoot,Ring Them Bells,"Ring them bells ye heathen from the city that dreams  
Ring them bell from the sanctuaries, 'cross the valleys and streams  
For they're deep and they're wide, and the world's on its side  
And time is a-runnin' backwards and so is the bride  
Ring them bells St. Peter where the four winds blow  
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know  
Oh, it's rush hour now on the wheel of the plow  
And the sun is a-goin' down upon the sacred cow  
Ring them bells sweet Martha for the poor man's son  
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one  
For the shepherd is asleep where the willow weep  
And the mountains are filled with lost sheep  
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf  
Ring them bells all of us who are left  
Ring them bells for the chosen few  
Who will judge the many when the game is through?  
Ring them bells for the time that flies  
For the child who cries when innocence dies  
Ring them bells St. Catherine from the top of the roof  
Ring the bells from the fortress for the lilies that bloom  
For the lines are long and the fighting is strong  
And they're breakin' down the distance between right and wrong

Gordon Lightfoot,Rosanna,"Rosanna makes my day begin  
With kisses for a king  
And coffee on a silver tray  
She sees the shape I'm in  
And if she should ever break away  
I'd follow close behind her  
'Cause Rosanna yes Rosanna  
Rules my heart  
  
Rosanna knows the times I keep  
A fire softly glows  
And the shadows lick the walls  
She knows when I'm asleep  
The dinner's served at eight o'clock on time  
And all is well by nine  
'Cause Rosanna yes Rosanna  
Rules my heart  
  
Rosanna moves across the floor  
Her perfume fills the air  
As she walks beside my easy chair  
I touch her hand once more  
And I may never sleep again  
I like the bag she put me in  
  
Rosanna knows the ways of a man  
But not the way I feel  
I don't really care what happens now  
It's catch me if you can  
For no matter what occasion should arise  
She likes to sympathize  
'Cause Rosanna yes Rosanna  
Rosanna, Rosanna  
Rules my heart

I'll show the Sea of Tranquility  
You can have any flavor you happen see  
  
I live in the shade of a forest of green  
In the wildest of woodlands that you've ever seen  
There's rabbits and quail and tender young snails  
As brown as the seaweed on old rusty nails  
  
There's fireflies dancing in the cool evening breeze  
There's love and romancin' as nice as you please  
There's otters and frogs and spotted ground hogs  
And wiley old weasels in rotted out logs  
  
There's rivers of rainbow and grey mountain trout  
And little dark holes where the varmints hang out  
There's foxes and hares in traps and in snares  
And lots of bald eagles so you'd better take care  
  
So if you've got the time and you'd like to pass by  
Come down around midnight and give us a try

Gordon Lightfoot,Seven Island Suite,"Seven islands to the high side of the bay, 'cross the bay  
To the sunset through the blue light of a fiery autumn haze  
We went walking on the high side of the bay on a chilly morn  
And we saw how leaves had fallen on the beds where trees were born  
Any man in his right mind could not fail to be made aware  
Any woman with a gift of wisdom would not seek her answers there  
  
Seven islands to the high side of the bay if you're looking west  
To the sunset you can see it, all in fiery autumn dress  
Anytime would be the right time to come up to your bed of boughs  
Anybody with a wish to wander could not fail but to be aroused  
  
Living high in the city, guess you think it's a pretty good way  
You get to learn but when you get burned you got nothing to say  
You seem to think because you got chicken to go you're in luck  
Fortune will not find you in your mansion or your truck  
Brothers will desert you when you're down and shit out of luck  
  
Look around at the morning, guess you're doing the best you can  
Surely you know that when you go nobody gives you a hand  
Think of the air you're breathing in, think of the time you waste  
Think of the right and wrong and consider the frown on your face  
  
It's time you tried living on the high side of the bay, you need a rest  
Any woman or a man with a wish to fade away could be so blessed  
Fortune will not find you in your mansion turned to gold  
Brothers will desert you when your nights turn long and cold  
  
If you feel it you better believe it, you're gonna see it, so you really  
know  
It is rising like a feather, dipping and dancing from below  
There's a new wave that is breaking in the wake of a passing ship  
Every nation's gonna be shaken, put it together, don't let it slip

Gordon Lightfoot,Sit Down Young Stranger,"I'm standin' at the doorway  
My head bowed in my hands  
Not knowin' where to sit  
Not knowin' where I stand  
My father looms above me  
For him there is no rest  
My mothers arms enfold me  
And hold me to her breast  
They say you been out wanderin'  
They say you travelled far  
Sit down young stranger  
And tell us who you are  
The room has all gone misty  
My thoughts are all in spin  
Sit down young stranger  
And tell us where you been  
Well, I've been up to the mountain  
I've walked down by the sea  
I never questioned no one  
And no one questioned me  
My love was given freely  
And oftimes was returned  
I never came to borrow  
I only came to learn  
Sometimes it did get lonely  
But it taught me how to cry  
And laughter came too easy  
For life to pass me by  
I never had a dollar  
That I didn't earn with pride  
'Cause I had a million daydreams  
To keep me satisfied  
And will you gather daydreams  
Or will you gather wealth  
How can you find your fortune  
When you cannot find yourself?  
My mothers eyes grow misty  
There's a tremblin' in her hand  
Sit down young stranger  
I do not understand  
And will you try and tell us  
You've been too long at school  
That knowledge is not needed  
That power does not rule  
That war is not the answer  
That young men should not die  
Sit down young stranger  
I wait for your reply  
The answer is not easy  
For souls are not reborn  
To wear the crown of peace  
You must wear the crown of thorns  
If Jesus, had a reason  
I'm sure He would not tell  
They treated Him so badly  
How could He wish them well

And knock me down again

And slander my good name

In some hidden valley where the twirlin' river twines  
Where the fish swim up and down  
And the sparklin' water falls  
Where the thunder rolls  
And the lonely puma calls  
  
Somewhere on the mountain I'll take another name  
Rid my mind of memories and start my life again  
Somewhere in the wilderness  
I'll build a cabin small  
Then forget so I  
Won't remember you at all

There's a fever around I don't know what to do  
When I'm drinking to you  
I get down in my shoes in a waltz with the blues  
  
Sometimes I don't mind the sunshine  
Sometimes I need the rest  
Sometimes I don't mind a good time  
Sometimes I do what's best  
  
When I'm thinking of you  
There's a feeling inside which is long overdue  
When I'm drinking to you  
I get down in the mouth tell me what can I do  
  
Sometimes I don't mind the sunshine  
Sometimes I need the change  
Sometimes I don't mind a fun time  
To me it's all the same  
  
When I'm thinking of you  
There's a fever around I don't know what to do  
When I'm drinking to you  
I get down in my shoes in a waltz with the blues"
Gordon Lightfoot,Song For A Winter's Night,"The lamp is burnin' low upon my table top  
The snow is softly fallin'  
The air is still within the silence of my room  
I hear your voice softly callin'  
  
If I could only have you near  
To breathe a sigh or two  
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love  
Upon this winter night with you  
  
The smoke is rising in the shadows overhead  
My glass is almost empty  
I read again between the lines upon the page  
The words of love you sent me  
  
If I could know within my heart  
That you were lonely too  
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love  
Upon this winter night with you  
  
The fire is dying now, my lamp is growing dim  
The shades of night are liftin'  
The mornin' light steals across my windowpane  
Where webs of snow are driftin'  
  
If I could only have you near  
To breathe a sigh or two  
I would be happy just to hold the hands I love  
And to be once again with with you  
To be once again with with you

Gordon Lightfoot,Songs The Minstrel Sang,"One, two, three, four  
  
It's almost over, it's almost done  
And you can't put the blame on anyone  
It's almost easy and it's almost fun  
Did you get caught with your britches on?  
  
Hi, derry day in the month of May  
Was the song the minstrel sang  
To the good of Robin Hood  
Maid Marion and all the gang  
  
His aim was mean and his shot was clean  
And his suit was the shade of evergreen  
The folks he knew, hadn't naught to fear  
When the sheriff was there, they were over here  
  
Hi, derry doon in the month of June  
Was the song the minstrel sung  
To the good of Robin Hood's  
Good name and a place to run  
  
He loved strong ale and a run down jail  
Was the kind of a scene where he never failed  
There was no man on the sea or land  
Who could get Maid Marion on the trail

Gordon Lightfoot,Spanish Moss,"Let go darlin'

Gordon Lightfoot,"Spin, Spin","So fine, so fine the web you spin,

I do not know what fate is mine!  
All the day sit and spin,

Gordon Lightfoot,Station Master,"In the dawn's early light  
From a long and a sleepless night  
She returned again this morning  
From her long and restless flight  
And my red hollow eyes  
Did not show her much surprise  
As she lay right down beside me  
Like she never said goodbye  
Please help me station master  
Is the evening train on time?  
The well's run dry up yonder  
There's another down the line  
It was all I could bear  
Just to watch her lying there  
Disowned and ragged princess  
With the sun locked in her hair  
So cold, so frail  
With her mind locked in a jail  
The victim of confusion  
Never knowing she could fail  
Please help me station master  
Is the evening train on time?  
The well's run dry up yonder  
There's another down the line  
So I rocked her to sleep  
Then I got up on my feet  
And the day was filled with sunshine  
As I gazed across the street  
And the door seemed to say  
Over here, step this way  
The station is for travelers  
Even you must ride someday  
Please help me station master  
Is the evening train on time?  
The well's run dry up yonder  
There's another down the line

Can I stay for just a while?  
Forgive me if I'm weary  
I ain't had much, much time to smile

Gordon Lightfoot,Summer Side Of Life,"He came down through fields of green  
On the summer side of life  
His love was ripe  
  
There was no illusions  
On the summer side of life  
Only tenderness  
  
And if you saw him now  
You'd wonder why he would cry  
The whole day long  
  
There was young girls everywhere  
On the summer side of life  
They talked all night  
  
To the young men that they knew

Gordon Lightfoot,The House You Live In,"Go first in the world, go forth with your fears  
Remember a price must be paid  
Be always too soon, be never too fast  
At the time when all bets must be laid  
Beware of the darkness, be kind to your children  
Remember the woman who waits  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate  
  
When you're caught by the gale and you're full under sail  
Beware of the dangers below  
And the song that you sing should not be too sad  
And be sure not to sing it too slow  
Be calm in the face of all common disgraces  
And know what they're doin' it for  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your door  
  
When you're out on the road and feelin' quite lost  
Consider the burden of fame  
And he who is wise will not criticize  
When other men fail at the game  
Beware of strange faces and dark dingy places  
Be careful while bending the law  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your door  
  
When you're down in the dumps and not ready to deal  
Decide what it is that you need  
Is it money or love, is it learnin' to live  
Or is it the mouth you must feed  
Be known as a man who will always be candid  
On questions that do not relate  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate  
And the house you live in will never fall down  
If you pity the stranger who stands at your gate

I'm walkin' up and down the hall talkin' to the silent wall  
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you  
I think I've almost lost my mind I think about you all the time  
I'm goin' crazy yes I know and I don't have far to go  
The way you treat me is a shame but I'll keep lovin' you the same  
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you  
[ guitar - piano ]  
I keep your letters I should burn I wear your ring I should return  
But there's a million foolish things I do  
It makes me cry but you would laugh to know I kiss your photograph  
I'll lose my mind before I'm over you  
I think I've almost lost my mind...

Loretta Lynn,Before The Next Teardrop Falls,"If she brings you happiness then I wish you both the best  
It's your happiness that matters most of all  
But if she ever breaks your heart if the teardrops ever start  
I'll be there before the next teardrop falls  
Though it hurts to let you go darling I want you to know

Loretta Lynn,Behind Closed Doors,"My baby makes me proud Lord don't he makes me proud

But when they turn out the lights I know he'll be leavin' with me

Loretta Lynn,Best Years Of My Life,"Thank goodness for the curtains that I draped around the windows in my room  
They keep the sun from shining through so it won't find me here in all my
gloom  
My eyes are red and swollen from the tears that baby's leaving me as left  
I haven't got the heart to go out to face the world alone just yet  
God knows I'm just as empty as the closet where he used to hang his clothes
And passing by that mirror I see ten years of my life just come and go  
The radio is playing some old song that baby used to sing to me  
And in between my heartbeats Lord I think about the way it used to be  
I tied the best years of my life around his love  
Passing my world to his and gave my heart the cause  
I believed him everything is sad I thought that how it was  
I tied the best years of my life around his love  
  
I crossed the bridge of memory  
Where the grass was green and his sweet dream was mine  
But all about is over now he's broken all those precious ties that bind  
I tied the best years of my life

Loretta Lynn,Blue Christmas,"Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul  
With a corn cop pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal  
  
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say  
He was made out of snow  
But the children know how he came to life one day  
There must of been some magic in  
That ol' silk cap they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
  
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be  
And the children say he could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the snowman knew the snow was hot that day  
So he said lets run and have some fun before I melt away  
Down to the village with a broom stick in his hand  
Runnin' here and there all around the square  
Sayin' catch me if you can  
  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop  
  
Frosty the snowman  
Had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye sayin' please don't cry  
I'll be back again some day

Loretta Lynn,Coal Miner's Daughter,"Well, I was borned a coal miner's daughter,  
In a cabin, on a hill in butcher holler.  
We were poor but we had love,  
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of,  
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar.  
  
My daddy worked all night in the Van ]Lear coal mines.  
All day long in the field a hoin' corn.  
Mommy rocked the babies at night,  
And read the bible by the coal oil light,  
And ever' thing would start all over come break of morn.  
  
Daddy loved and raised eight kids on a miner's pay.  
Mommy scrubbed our clothes on a washboard ever' day.  
Why I've seen her fingers bleed,  
To complain, there was no need,  
She'd smile in mommy's understanding way.  
  
In the summertime we didn't have shoes to wear.  
But in the wintertime we all got a brand new pair.  
From a mail order catalog  
Money made from selling a hog,  
Daddy always managed to get the money somewhere.  
  
Yeah, I'm proud to be a coal miner's daughter,  
I remember well, the well where I drew water.  
The work we done was hard,  
At night we'd sleep cause we were tired  
I never thought of ever leaving butcher holler.  
  
Well a lot of things have changed since a way back then  
And it feels so good to be back home again.  
Not much left but the floor, nothing lives here anymore,  
Except the memory of a coal miner's daughter

Blue must be the color angels choose  
A blue suit you proudly wore when you left to return no more

Blue days come and blue days go how I feel nobody knows  
Life is mighty empty without you  
There's a blue note in each song that I sang since you've been gone

Loretta Lynn,Cry Cry Cry,"Everybody knows where you go when the sun goes down

You're gonna cry cry cry and you cry alone  
When everyone's forgotten and you're left on your own you're gonna cry cry cry  
  
I lie awake at night and wait till you come in  
You stay a little while and then you're gone again  
Every question that I ask I git a lie lie lie for every lie you tell you're
gonna cry cry  
When your fickle love gets on oh no one will care for you  
When you come back to me for a little love that's true

When I remind you all of this you'll cry cry cry  
You're gonna cry cry cry and you'll cry and then

Loretta Lynn,Fly Away,"Standing alone in a storm of life  
Without any way to turn  
Tears are falling down like rain  
From the lessons that I have learned  
  
And I wish that I could fly away  
On the wings of a great golden bird  
To a place where there are no unhappy days  
And there are no unhappy words  
  
Yes, I wish that I could fly away  
To a land beyond this pain  
And lay my dreams on a mountain top  
And wash my mind in the rain  
  
Burned by the fire of an untrue love  
My heart is as cold as a stone  
And I know for sure that the road of life  
Is no place to travel alone  
  
And I wish that I could fly away  
To a land beyond this pain  
And lay my dreams on a mountain top  
And wash my mind in the rain  
  
Yes, I wish that I could fly away  
To a land beyond this pain  
And lay my dreams on a mountain top  
And wash my mind in the rain ?

Loretta Lynn,Frosty The Snowman,"Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose and two eyes made out of coal  
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say  
He was made of snow but the children know how he came to life one day  
There must have been some magic in that old silk that they found  
For when they placed it on his head he began to dance around  
Frosty the snowman was alive as he could be  
And the children say he could laugh and play just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the snowman knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said let's run and we'll have some fun before I melt away  
Down to the village with a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there all around the square saying catch me if you can  
He led them down the streets of town right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment when he heard him holler stop  
Frosty the snowman had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye sayin' don't you cry I'll be back again some day

Loretta Lynn,Harper Valley P.t.a.,"I want to tell you all a story about a Harper valley widowed wife  
Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper valley junior high  
Well, her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play  
And she said, 'mom I got a note here from the Harper valley PTA'  
  
Well the note said: Mrs.Johnson you're wearing your dresses way too high  
And it's reported you've been drinking and runnin' around with men and going
wild  
And we do't believe you ought to be a bringing up your little girl this way  
And it was signed by the secretary Harper valley PTA  
  
Well it happened that the PTA was gonna meet that very afternoon  
And they were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her mini-skirt into the
room  
And as she walked up to the blackboard, I still can recall the words she had
to say  
She said, 'I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper valley PTA'  
  
'well there's Bobby Taylor sitting there and seven times he's asked me for a
date  
And Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away  
And Mr. Baker can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town  
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled
completely down  
  
Well Mr. Harper couldn't be here 'cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar
again  
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath you'll find she's had a little nip
of gin  
And then you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother I'm not fit  
Well this is just a little hatin' place and you're all Harper valley
hypocrites  
  
No I wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way  
The day my momma socked it to the Harper valley PTA

And in her purse there's several thousand dollars  
Years of saving for one rainy day  
It scares her half to death to think of leaving  
She's never been out on her own before  
Too many nights she's cried while he was sleepin'  
Oh but she's not sure he loves her any more

All he has to do to hold her is to hold her  
Tell her how he feels down deep inside  
All he has to do to hold her is to hold her  
There's no way she would ever leave his side  
  
To him she's always been a special angel  
And so much more than he thought he deserved  
Oh how was she to know all he's been feeling  
When he could never put it into words  
He was so afraid one day she'd walk out on him  
He knows he's just a plain and simple man(Yes he is)  
He could easily tear down that wall between them  
Everything he needs to keep her's in his hands  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Maybe he'll wake up in time  
To hold me

I'm gonna come back in the morning and tell you how it was

","Well I just found out you let your baby down  
So I made up my mind and my face and I'm goin to town  
I'm gonna pay you back by doin you the way you've done me  
And some dude don't know how lucky he's about to be  
  
  
I'm gonna do somebody right just to do you wrong  
I'm gonna make his day, if it takes me all night long  
I'm gonna pick him up, love him up, and really come on strong  
I'm gonna do somebody right, I'm gonna break your heart tonight  
I'm gonna do somebody right just to do you wrong  
  
I'm gonna give you just what you deserve  
Cause the crime sure fit's the sentence you must serve  
Then I'm gonna make it twice as hard on you I know because  
I'm gonna come back in the morning and tell you how it was"
Loretta Lynn,I'm Living In Two Worlds,"I'm living in two worlds dividing my time  
Unhappy in your world and lonesome in mine  
  
When I'm in your world I just pretend  
That I'm really happy though I don't fit in  
Then I drift in my world so cold and alone  
I'm living in two worlds where do I belong  
I'm living in two worlds...  
  
Old friends in your world are new friends to me  
So I can't take part in your old memories  
Our love shared in two worlds that don't turn the same  
We both have our own worlds and neither can change  
I'm living in two worlds...

And just a little talk with my Jesus made me whole  
(Now let us) have a little talk with Jesus (let us) tell him all about our
troubles  
(He will) hear our faintest cry (and we will) answer by and by  
(Now when you) feel a little prayer wheel turning  
(Then you'll) know a little fire is burning  
(You will) find a little talk with Jesus makes it right  
  
(Now let us) have a little talk  
  
I may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears  
But Jesus is a friend who watches day and night  
I go to him in prayer he knows my every care  
And just a little talk with my Jesus gonna makes it right  
(Now let us) have a little talk  
(Makes it right)"
Loretta Lynn,Just Get Up And Close The Door,"How can I be sure you're being honest with me can I take your love for truth  
There comes a time in every woman's life when she needs a little proof  
So show me something different something I ain't never seen before  
This time instead of gettin' up and goin' home to her just get up and close
the door  
Just get up and close the door  
And say you'll stay with me tonight say you won't regret the morning light  
Then I'll believe the words of love you've said to me before  
If you'll just get up and close the door  
This time instead of gettin' up and goin' home to her just get up and close
the door

Loretta Lynn,Kaw-liga,"Kaw-Liga was a wooden Indian standing by the door  
He fell in love with an Indian maid over in the antique store  
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show  
So she could never answer yes or no  
He always wore his Sunday feathers and held a tomahawk  
The maiden wore her beads and braids and hoped someday he'd talk  
Kaw-Liga too stubborn to ever show a sign  
Because his heart was made of knoty pine  
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he never got a kiss  
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he don't know what he missed  
Is it any wonder that his face is red  
Kaw-Liga that poor ol' wooden head  
Kaw-Liga was a lonely Indian never went nowhere  
His heart was set on the Indian maid with the coal black hair  
Kaw-Liga just stood there and never let it show  
So she could never answer yes or no  
And then one day a wealthy customer bought the Indian maid  
And took her oh so far away but ol' Kaw-Liga stayed  
Kaw-Liga just stands there as lonely as can be  
And wishes he was still an old pine tree  
Poor ol' Kaw-Liga he never got a kiss...

Then I settled back and closed my eyes again  
I reached out for my baby for some early mornin' lovin'  
Then the terrible truth came staggering through my head  
There was just an empty pillow and the mem'ry of his kisses  
Baby wasn't there beside me in the bed  
It's the morning after baby let me down  
It's the daybreak and the heartbreak that I found  
Only silence to torment me no strong hands to touch me gently  
It's the mornin' after baby let me down  
  
There was nothing to hold on to but the sheets that fell around me  
And I started into trembling like a leaf  
How could he ever leave me he was more than just a lover  
And he knew all the ways to make me feel complete  
I can taste the salty teardrops God it's gettin' hard to swallow  
Hope a glass of wine will take his love away  
Got no appetite for eatin' just a sick and empty feeling  
What a good for nothing way to start the day  
It's the morning after baby...

And I started into trembling like a leaf  
How could he ever leave me he was more than just a lover  
And he knew all the ways to make me feel complete  
I can taste the salty teardrops God it's gettin' hard to swallow  
Hope a glass of wine will take his love away  
Got no appetite for eatin' just a sick and empty feeling  
What a good for nothing way to start the day  
It's the morning after baby..."
Loretta Lynn,My Angel Mother,"I'm writing this song about a girl that I know  
She's just as pure as the powdery snow.  
I might search this world over, but I'd never find  
No one to take the place of this mother of mine.  
  
Mother. That's the sweetest name of them all.  
You're an angel on earth and to me you are worth  
More than anything else in the world.  
  
I love you more day by day - and I could never repay  
All the things that you've done for me.  
Your heart is filled with joyous times  
And your eyes - how they shine.  
That's the story of this mother of mine.  
  
Mother, you will never, not ever grow old.  
You're an angel on earth and to me you are worth  
More than mountains of silver and gold.  
  
Mother...

Loretta Lynn,My Shoes Keep Walking Back To You,"I may say that I don't care hold up head up in the air

And that's when I miss you most of all

My lips keep calling for you and my shoes keep walking back to you

He became a grandpa this morning

For the buyers and the sellers were no different fellers than what I confess
to be  
And it causes me shame to know I'm not the gal that I should be  
Put your hand in the hand...  
  
Mama taught me how to pray before I reached the age of seven  
And when I'm down on my knees that's when I'm close to heaven  
Daddy lived his life for eight kids and wife you do what you must do  
But he showed me enough of what it takes to get you through  
Put your hand in the hand...  
Put your hand in the hand...  
Put your hand in the hand..."
Loretta Lynn,Race Is On,"Well I feel tears wellin' up cold and deep inside like my heart's sprung a big
break  
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful that I may never shake  
Now you might say that I was takin' it hard that he wrote me off with a call  
But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow when I may break right down and
bawl  
Now the race is on and here comes pride up the backstretch  
Heartaches are going to the inside  
My tears are holdin' back they're tryin' not to fall  
My heart's out of the runnin' true love scratched for another's sake  
The race is on and it looks like heartaches and the winner loses all  
[ guitar - steel ]  
One day I ventured in love never once suspectin' what the final result would
be  
How I lived in fear of waking up each morning and findin' that you're gone
from me  
Cause there's ache and pain in my heart for today was the one that I hated to
face  
Somebody new came up to win him and I came out in second place  
Now the race is on...

There's been a load of compromising on the road to his horizon  
But he's gonna be where the lights are shining on him

Like a Rhinestone Cowboy getting cards and letter from people he don't even

And offers coming over the phone  
  
He really don't mind the rain and a smile can hide all the pain  
But you're down when you're riding the train that's taking the long way  
And he dreams of the things he'll do  
With a subway token and a dollar tucked inside his shoe  
There'll be a load of compromising

Loretta Lynn,Snowbird,"Beneath this snowy mantle cold and clean  
The unborn grass lies waiting for its coat to turn to green  
The snowbird sings the song he always sings  
And speaks to me of flowers that will bloom again in spring  
When I was young my heart was young then too  
Anything that it would tell me that's the thing that I would do  
But now I feel such emptiness within  
For the thing that I want most in life is the thing that I can't win  
Spread your tiny wings and fly away  
And take the snow back with you where it came from on that day  
The one I love forever is untrue  
And if I could you know that I would fly away with you  
[ dobro ]  
The breeze along the river seems to say  
That he'll only break my heart again should I decide to stay  
So little snowbird take it with you when you go  
To that land of gentle breezes where the peaceful waters flow  
Spread your tiny wings...  
And if I could you know that I would fly away with you

Bob Dylan,A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,"Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?  
And where have you been my darling young one?  
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains  
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways  
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests  
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans  
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?  
And what did you see, my darling young one?  
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it  
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it  
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'  
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'  
I saw a white ladder all covered with water  
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken  
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?  
And what did you hear, my darling young one?  
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'  
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world  
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'  
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'  
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'  
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter  
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard  
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
Oh, who did you meet my blue-eyed son?  
Who did you meet, my darling young one?  
I met a young child beside a dead pony  
I met a white man who walked a black dog  
I met a young woman whose body was burning  
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow  
I met one man who was wounded in love  
I met another man who was wounded in hatred  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard  
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?  
And what'll you do now my darling young one?  
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'  
I'll walk to the deepths of the deepest black forest  
Where the people are a many and their hands are all empty  
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters  
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison  
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden  
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten  
Where black is the color, where none is the number  
And I'll tell and think it and speak it and breathe it  
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it  
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'  
But I'll know my songs well before I start singin'  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.

","Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?  
And where have you been my darling young one?  
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains  
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways  
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests  
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans  
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
Oh, what did you see, my blue eyed son?  
And what did you see, my darling young one?  
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it  
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it  
I saw a black branch with blood that kept drippin'  
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleedin'  
I saw a white ladder all covered with water  
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken  
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?  
And what did you hear, my darling young one?  
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warnin'  
I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world  
I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazin'  
I heard ten thousand whisperin' and nobody listenin'  
I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughin'  
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter  
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard  
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
Oh, who did you meet my blue-eyed son?  
Who did you meet, my darling young one?  
I met a young child beside a dead pony  
I met a white man who walked a black dog  
I met a young woman whose body was burning  
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow  
I met one man who was wounded in love  
I met another man who was wounded in hatred  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard  
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.  
  
And what'll you do now, my blue-eyed son?  
And what'll you do now my darling young one?  
I'm a-goin' back out 'fore the rain starts a-fallin'  
I'll walk to the deepths of the deepest black forest  
Where the people are a many and their hands are all empty  
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters  
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison  
Where the executioner's face is always well hidden  
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten  
Where black is the color, where none is the number  
And I'll tell and think it and speak it and breathe it  
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it  
Then I'll stand on the ocean until I start sinkin'  
But I'll know my songs well before I start singin'  
And it's a hard, it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard  
It's a hard rain's a-gonna fall."
Bob Dylan,Abandoned Love,"I can hear the turning of the key  
I've been deceived by the clown inside of me.  
I thought that he was righteous but he's vain  
Oh, something's a-telling me I wear the ball and chain.  
  
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost  
He's always off somewhere when I need him most.  
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill  
But my heart is a-tellin' me I love ya still.  
  
I come back to the town from the flaming moon  
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon.  
I love to see you dress before the mirror  
Won't you let me in your room one time 'fore I finally disappear?  
  
Everybody's wearing a disguise  
To hide what they've got left behind their eyes.  
But me, I can't cover what I am  
Wherever the children go I'll follow them.  
  
I march in the parade of liberty  
But as long as I love you I'm not free.  
How long must I suffer such abuse  
Won't you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?  
  
I've given up the game, I've got to leave,  
The pot of gold is only make-believe.  
The treasure can't be found by men who search  
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church.  
  
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed,  
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list.  
My head tells me it's time to make a change  
But my heart is telling me I love ya but you're strange.  
  
One more time at midnight, near the wall  
Take off your heavy make-up and your shawl.  
Won't you descend from the throne, from where you sit?  
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it.

Bob Dylan,Absolutely Sweet Marie,"Well, your railroad gage, you know I just can't jump it  
Sometimes it gets so hard, you see  
I'm just sitting here beating on my trumpet  
With all these promises you left for me  
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?  
  
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick  
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me  
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic  
When you knew I had some other place to be  
Now where are you tonight, sweet Marie?  
  
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously  
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately.  
  
Well, six white horses that you did promise  
Were fin'ly delivered down to the penitentiary  
But to live outside the law, you must be honest  
I know you always say that you agree  
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?  
  
Well I don't know how it happened  
But the river-boat captain he knows my fate  
But ev'rybody else, even yourself  
They're just gonna have to wait.  
  
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets  
The Persian drunkard, he follows me  
Yes, I can take him to your house but I can't unlock it  
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key  
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?  
  
Now, I been in jail when all my mail showed  
That a man can't give his address out to bad company  
And now I stand here lookin' at your yellow railroad  
In the ruins of your balcony  
Wond'ring where you are tonight, sweet Marie?

Bob Dylan,Ain't No More Cane,"Ain't no more cane on the Brazos  
Oh, oh, oh, oh...  
Its all been ground down to molasses  
Oh, oh- oh, oh- oh...  
  
You shoulda been on the river in 1910  
They were driving the women just like they drove the men.  
  
Go down Old Hannah, don'cha rise no more  
Don't you rise up til Judgment Day's for sure  
  
Ain't no more cane on the Brazos

Captain, don't you do me like you done poor old Shine  
Well ya drove that bully til he went stone blind  
  
Wake up on a lifetime, hold up your own head  
Well you may get a pardon and then you might drop dead

Bob Dylan,Ain't Talkin',"As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden  
The wounded flowers were dangling from the vine  
I was passing by yon cool crystal fountain  
Someone hit me from behind  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Through this weary world of woe  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
No one on earth would ever know  
  
They say prayer has the power to heal  
So pray from the mother  
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell  
I am a-tryin' to love my neighbor and do good unto others  
But oh, mother, things ain't going well  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
There'll be no mercy for you once you've lost  
  
Now I'm all worn down by weeping  
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry  
If I catch my opponents ever sleeping  
I'll just slaughter 'em where they lie  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Through the world mysterious and vague  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' through the cities of the plague.  
  
Well, the whole world is filled with speculation  
The whole wide world which people say is round  
They will tear your mind away from contemplation  
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Eatin' hog eyed grease in a hog eyed town.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Some day you'll be glad to have me around.  
  
They will crush you with wealth and power  
Every waking moment you could crack  
I'll make the most of one last extra hour  
I'll revenge my father's death then I'll step back  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Hand me down my walkin' cane.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Got to get you out of my miserable brain.  
  
All my loyal and my much-loved companions  
They approve of me and share my code  
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned  
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
My mule is sick, my horse is blind.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Thinkin' 'bout that gal I left behind.  
  
Well, it's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flyin'  
Fame and honor never seem to fade  
The fire gone out but the light is never dyin'  
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Carryin' a dead man's shield  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' with a toothache in my heel  
  
The sufferin' is unending  
Every nook and cranny has its tears  
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending  
I'm not nursin' any superfluous fears  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Walkin' ever since the other night.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
Walkin' 'til I'm clean out of sight.  
  
As I walked out in the mystic garden  
On a hot summer day, a hot summer lawn  
Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon  
There's no one here, the gardener is gone  
  
Ain't talkin', just walkin'  
Up the road, around the bend.  
Heart burnin', still yearnin'  
In the last outback at the world's end.

Bob Dylan,All Along The Watchtower,"""There must be some way out of here,"" said the joker to the thief,  
""There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief.  
Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth,  
None of them along the line know what any of it is worth.""  
  
""No reason to get excited,"" the thief, he kindly spoke,  
""There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke.  
But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate,  
So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late.""  
  
All along the watchtower, princes kept the view  
While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.  
  
Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl,  
Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl.

Bob Dylan,Are You Ready,"Are you ready, are you ready?  
Are you ready, are you ready?  
  
Are you ready to meet Jesus?  
Are you where you ought to be?  
Will He know you when He sees you  
Or will He say, ""Depart from Me""?  
  
Are you ready, hope you're ready  
Am I ready, am I ready?  
Am I ready, am I ready?  
  
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren  
And to take up my cross?  
Have I surrendered to the will of God  
Or am I still like the boss?  
  
Am I ready, hope I'm ready.  
When the destruction cometh swiftly  
And there's no time to say a fare-thee-well  
Have you decided whether you want to be  
In heaven or in hell?  
  
Are you ready, are you ready?  
Have you got some unfinished business?  
Is there something holding you back?  
Are you thinking for yourself  
Or are you following the pack?  
  
Are you ready, hope you're ready  
Are you ready?  
  
Are you ready for the judgment?  
Are you ready for that terrible swift sword?  
Are you ready for Armageddon?  
Are you ready for the day of the Lord?  
  
Are you ready, I hope you're ready?

Bob Dylan,Arthur Mcbride,"Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride,  
As we went a-walkin' down by the seaside,  
Mark now what followed and what did betide,  
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'  
Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp,  
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp  
And a little wee drummer intending to camp,  
For the day bein' pleasant and charmin'.  
  
""Good morning, good morning,"" the Sergeant he cried.  
""And the same to you, gentlemen,"" we did reply,  
Intending no harm but meant to pass by,  
For it bein' on Christmas mornin'  
""But,"" says he, ""My fine fellows, if you will enlist,  
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick to your fist,  
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust,  
And drink the king's health in the morning.  
  
""For a soldier, he leads a very fine life,  
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife,  
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife,  
And he always lives pleasant and charmin',  
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean,  
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen.  
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean,  
And sup on thin gruel in the morning.""  
  
""But,"" says Arthur, ""I wouldn't be proud of your clothes,  
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose,  
But you dare not change them one night, for you know  
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning,  
And although that we're single and free,  
We take great delight in our own company,  
We have no desire strange places to see,  
Although that your offers are charming.  
  
""And we have no desire to take your advance,  
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance,  
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France,  
Where we would get shot without warning,""  
""Oh no,"" says the Sergeant. ""I'll have no such chat,  
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats,  
For if you insult me with one other word,  
I'll cut off your heads in the morning.""  
  
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs,  
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades  
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head  
And bid them take that as fair warning.  
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides,  
We flung them as far as we could in the tide,  
""Now take them up, devils!"" cried Arthur McBride,  
""And temper their edge in the mornin'!""  
  
And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow,  
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow,  
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll,  
And bade it a tedious returning,  
And we havin' no money, paid them off in cracks.  
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs,  
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks,  
And left them for dead in the morning.  
  
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes,  
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits,  
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts  
And bid them look sharp in the mornin'.

Bob Dylan,As I Went Out One Morning,"As I went out one morning  
To breathe the air around Tom Paine's,  
I spied the fairest damsel  
That ever did walk in chains.  
I offer'd her my hand,  
She took me by the arm.  
I knew that very instant,  
She meant to do me harm.  
  
""Depart from me this moment,""  
I told her with my voice.  
Said she, ""But I don't wish to,""  
Said I, ""But you have no choice.""  
""I beg you, sir,"" she pleaded  
From the corners of her mouth,  
""I will secretly accept you  
And together we'll fly south.""  
  
Just then Tom Paine, himself,  
Came running from across the field,  
Shouting at this lovely girl  
And commanding her to yield.  
And as she was letting go her grip,  
Up Tom Paine did run,  
""I'm sorry, sir,"" he said to me,  
""I'm sorry for what she's done.""

Bob Dylan,Ballad For A Friend,"Sad I'm sittin' on the railroad track,  
Watchin' that old smokestack.  
Train is a-leavin' but it won't be back.  
  
Years ago we hang around,  
Watchin' trains roll through the town.  
Now that train is a-graveyard bound.  
  
Where we go up in that North country,  
Lakes and streams and mines so free,  
I had no better friend than he.  
  
Something happened to him that day,  
I thought I heard a stranger say,  
I hung my head and stole away.  
  
A diesel truck was headin' down,  
Pullin' down a heavy load.  
It left him on a Utah road.  
  
They carried him back to his home town,  
His mother cried, his sister moaned,  
Listenin' to them church bells tone.  
  
A diesel truck was rollin' slow,  
Pullin' down a heavy load.  
And it left him on a Utah road.

Bob Dylan,Ballad In Plain D,"I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.  
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn.  
I courted her proudly but now she is gone,  
Gone as the season she's taken.  
  
Through young summer's breeze, I stole her away  
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.  
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,  
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.  
  
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.  
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.  
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone  
By the jealousy of others around her.  
  
For her parasite sister, I had no respect,  
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.  
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect  
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.  
  
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused,  
The changes I was going through can't even be used,  
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose  
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.  
  
With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip  
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,  
Noticing not that I'd already slipped  
To a sin of love's false security.  
  
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,  
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,  
Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, ""Please,  
What's wrong and what's exactly the matter?""  
  
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,  
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.  
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen  
Tumbled all down into pieces.  
  
""The tragic figure!"" her sister did shout,  
""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!""  
And I in my armor, turning about  
And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.  
  
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound  
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.  
And she in between, the victim of sound,  
Soon shattered as a child 'neath her shadows.  
  
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.  
I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.  
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night  
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.  
  
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.  
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet.  
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met  
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.  
  
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,  
""How good, how good does it feel to be free?""  
And I answer them most mysteriously,  
""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?""

","I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze.

From her mother and sister, though close did they stay.  
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day,  
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us.  
  
Of the two sisters, I loved the young.  
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one.  
The constant scapegoat, she was easily undone  
By the jealousy of others around her.  
  
For her parasite sister, I had no respect,  
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect.  
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect  
As a crutch for her scenes and her society.  
  
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused,  
The changes I was going through can't even be used,  
For the lies that I told her in hopes not to lose  
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime.  
  
With unknown consciousness, I possessed in my grip  
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped,  
Noticing not that I'd already slipped  
To a sin of love's false security.  
  
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace,  
Answers of emptiness, voice vacancies,  
Till the tombstones of damage read me no questions but, ""Please,  
What's wrong and what's exactly the matter?""  
  
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen,  
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream.  
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen  
Tumbled all down into pieces.  
  
""The tragic figure!"" her sister did shout,  
""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out!""  
And I in my armor, turning about  
And nailing her to the ruins of her pettiness.  
  
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound  
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground.  
And she in between, the victim of sound,  
Soon shattered as a child 'neath her shadows.  
  
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight.  
I gagged twice, doubled, tears blinding my sight.  
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night  
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me.  
  
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet.  
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet.  
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met  
Will be fully aware of how precious she is.  
  
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me,  
""How good, how good does it feel to be free?""  
And I answer them most mysteriously,  
""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?"""
Bob Dylan,Ballad Of A Thin Man,"You walk into the room with your pencil in your hand

And you say, ""Impossible!"" as he hands you a bone  
And something is happening here but you don't know what it is

He crosses himself and then he clicks his high heels  
And without further notice, he asks you how it feels  
And he says, ""Here is your throat back, thanks for the loan""  
And you know something is happening but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
Now, you see this one-eyed midget shouting the word ""Now""  
And you say, ""For what reason?"" and he says, ""How""  
And you say, ""What does this mean?"" and he screams back, ""You're a cow!  
Give me some milk or else go home""  
And you know something's happening but you don't know what it is  
Do you, Mr. Jones?  
  
Well, you walk into the room like a camel, and then you frown  
You put your eyes in your pocket and your nose on the ground

Bob Dylan,Bessie Smith,"Bessie was more than just a friend of mine

Bob Dylan,Billy 1,"There's guns across the river aimin' at ya  
Lawman on your trail, he'd like to catch ya  
Bounty hunters, too, they'd like to get ya  
Billy, they don't like you to be so free.  
  
Campin' out all night on the berenda  
Dealin' cards 'til dawn in the hacienda  
Up to Boot Hill they'd like to send ya  
Billy, don't you turn your back on me.  
  
Playin' around with some sweet senorita  
Into her dark hallway she will lead ya  
In some lonesome shadows she will greet ya  
Billy, you're so far away from home.  
  
There's eyes behind the mirrors in empty places  
Bullet holes and scars between the spaces  
There's always one more notch and ten more paces  
Billy, and you're walkin' all alone.  
  
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number  
So sleep with one eye open when you slumber  
Every little sound just might be thunder  
Thunder from the barrel of his gun.  
  
Guitars will play your grand finale  
Down in some Tularosa alley,  
Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley  
Billy, you're so far away from home.  
  
There's always some new stranger sneakin' glances  
Some trigger-happy fool willin' to take chances  
And some old whore from San Pedro to make advances  
Advances on your spirit and your soul.  
  
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down  
They've hired Pat Garrett to force a showdown.  
Billy, don't it make ya feel so low-down  
To be shot down by the man who was your friend?  
  
Hang on to your woman if you got one  
Remember in El Paso, once, you shot one.  
She may have been a whore, but she was a hot one  
Billy, you been runnin' for so long.

Bob Dylan,Black Diamond Bay,"Up on the white veranda  
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat.  
Her passport shows a face  
From another time and place  
She looks nothing like that.  
And all the remnants of her recent past  
Are scattered in the wild wind.  
She walks across the marble floor  
Where a voice from the gambling room is callin' her to come on in.  
She smiles, walks the other way  
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down  
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write.  
""Pardon, monsieur,"" the desk clerk says,  
Carefully removes his fez,  
""Am I hearing you right?""  
And as the yellow fog is lifting  
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor.  
She passes him on the spiral staircase  
Thinking he's the Soviet Ambassador,  
She starts to speak, but he walks away  
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
A soldier sits beneath the fan  
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring.  
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out.  
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout,  
""Can you see anything?""  
Then the Greek appears on the second floor  
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck,  
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle,  
Says, ""Open up another deck.""  
But the dealer says, ""Attendez-vous, s'il vous plait,''  
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh  
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough.  
He tried to grab the woman's hand,  
Said, ""Here's a ring, it cost a grand.""  
She said, ""That ain't enough.""  
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags  
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb.  
She passed the door that the Greek had locked,  
Where a handwritten sign read, ""Do Not Disturb.""  
She knocked upon it anyway  
As the sun went down and the music did play  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
""I've got to talk to someone quick!""  
But the Greek said, ""Go away,"" and he kicked the chair to the floor.  
He hung there from the chandelier.  
She cried, ""Help, there's danger near  
Please open up the door!""  
Then the volcano erupted  
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above.  
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner  
Thinking of forbidden love.  
But the desk clerk said, ""It happens every day,""  
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away  
On Black Diamond Bay.  
  
As the island slowly sank  
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room.  
The dealer said, ""It's too late now.  
You can take your money, but I don't know how  
You'll spend it in the tomb.""  
The tiny man bit the soldier's ear  
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew,  
While she's out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her,  
""My darling, je vous aime beaucoup.""  
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray  
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away  
From Black Diamond Bay.  
  
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A.,  
Watching old Cronkite on the seven o'clock news.  
It seems there was an earthquake that  
Left nothing but a Panama hat  
And a pair of old Greek shoes.  
Didn't seem like much was happening,  
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer.  
Seems like every time you turn around  
There's another hard-luck story that you're gonna hear  
And there's really nothing anyone can say  
And I never did plan to go anyway  
To Black Diamond Bay.

Bob Dylan,Blackjack Davey,"Black Jack Davey come a-riden' on back,  
A-whistlin' loud and merry.  
Made the woods around him ring,  
And he charmed the heart of a lady,  
Charmed the heart of a lady.  
  
""How old are you, my pretty little miss,  
How old are you, my honey""  
She answered to him with a lovin' smile  
""I'll be sixteen come Sunday,  
Be sixteen come Sunday.""

Got behind him on his horse  
And they rode off together.  
They rode off together.  
  
At night the boss came home  
Inquiring about this lady.

I'll bring back my lady.""

Inquiring about this lady.

Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own.  
  
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for  
You heard me saying a prayet for someone I really could care for.  
  
And suddenly there appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold  
I heard someone whisper, ""Please, adore me""  
And when I looked my moon had turned to gold.  
  
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone  
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own

Bob Dylan,Bob Dylan's 115Th Dream,"I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land  
I yelled down to Captain Arab, I'll have ya understand,  
Who came running to the deck and said ""Boys! Forget the whale -  
We're goin' over yonder. Cut the engines. Change the sails.""  
""Haul on that bowline!"" we sang that melody,  
Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea.  
  
""I think I'll call it America."" I said as we hit land.  
I took a deep breath. I fell down, I could not stand.  
Captain Arab he starting writing out some deeds  
And said ""Let's build us a fort and start buying the place with beads.?  
Just then a cop come down the street crazy as a loon  
And throws us all in jail for carryin' harpoons.  
  
Aw, me, I busted out - don't even ask me how,  
I went lookin' for some help, I walked past a Guernsey cow  
Who directed me down to the Bowery slums  
Where people carried signs around sayin' ""BAN THE BUMS!"".  
I jumped right in line, sayin' ""I hope that I'm not late""  
When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight.  
  
I went into a restaurant lookin' for the cook -  
I told him I was the editor of a famous etiquette book.  
The waiter he was handsome and he wore a powder blue cape.  
I ordered up some Suzette, I said ""Could you please make that crepe?""  
Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boiling fat -  
Food was flyin' everywhere - I left without my hat.  
  
I didn't mean to be nosy so I went into a bank  
To try to get some bail for the boys back in the tank.  
They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants.  
They threw me in the alley, when up comes this girl from France  
Who invited me to her place. I went, but she had a friend  
Who knocked me out an' robbed my boots an' was I on the street again.  
  
I went up to a big house with a U.S. flag upon display.  
I said ""Can you please help me out, I got some friends down the way.""  
The man said ""Get out of here or I'll tear you limb from limb.""  
I said ""You know, they refused Jesus, too."" He said ""You're not him.  
Get out of here before I break your bones. I'm not your pop.""  
I decided to have him arrested and went looking for a cop.  
  
I ran back outside and got into a cab  
I ran out the other door - this English man said ""Fab!""  
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood  
Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood.  
I ran right through the door like a hobo sailor does,  
But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was  
I repeated that all my friends were in jail, with a sigh.  
He gave me his card and said ""Call me if they die.""  
I shook his hand and said goodbye and went back out on the street,  
When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet.  
A pay phone was ringin' - and it just about blew my mind -  
When I picked it up an' said ""hello"", this foot came through the line!  
  
Well about this time I was fed up at trying to make a stab  
At gettin' any help for my friends and Captain Arab.  
I needed a coin to flip, like either heads or tails,  
Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail.  
So I hocked my sailor's suit an' I got a coin to flip.  
It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship.  
  
Well I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast.  
I was ripping it to shreds when this Coast Guard boat went past.  
They asked me my name and I said ""Captain Kidd"".  
They believed me but they wanted to know exactly what I did.  
I said ""For the Pope of Eyruke I was employed""  
They let me go right away, they were very paranoid.  
  
Well the last I heard of Arab he was stuck on the side of a whale  
That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail,  
But the funniest thing was - as I was leavin' the bay -  
I saw three ships sailing and they were all headed my way.  
So I asked the Captain what his name was an' how come he didn't drive a
truck??  
He said his name was Columbus an' I just said ""Good luck...""

Bob Dylan,Canadee-I-O,"Well, it's all of fair and handsome girl,  
She's all in her tender years.  
She fell in love with a sailor boy,  
It's true she loved him well.  
For to go off to sea with him  
Like she did not know how,  
She longed to see that seaport town  
Of Canadee-i-o.  
  
So she bargained with the sailor boy,  
All for a piece of gold.  
Straightaway then he led her  
Down into the hold,  
Sayin', ""I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes,  
Your jacket shall be blue.  
You'll see that seaport town  
Of Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when the other sailors heard the news,  
Well, they fell into a rage,  
And with all the ship's company  
They were willing to engage.  
Saying, ""We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys,  
Overboard we'll throw her.  
She'll never see that seaport town  
Called Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when the captain he heard the news,  
Well, he too fell in a rage,  
And with the whole ship's company  
He was willing to engage,  
Sayin', ""She'll stay in sailor's clothes,  
Her color shall be blue,  
She'll see that seaport town  
Call Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when they come down to Canada  
Scarcely 'bout half a year,  
She's married this bold captain  
Who called her his dear.  
She's dressed in silks and satins now,  
She cuts a gallant show,  
Finest of the ladies  
Down Canadee-i-o.  
  
Come, all you fair and tender girls,  
Wheresoever you may be,  
I'd have you to follow your own true love  
Whene'er he goes to sea.  
For if the sailors prove false to you,  
Well, the captain, he might prove true.  
You'll see the honor I have gained  
By the wearing of the blue.

","Well, it's all of fair and handsome girl,  
She's all in her tender years.  
She fell in love with a sailor boy,  
It's true she loved him well.  
For to go off to sea with him  
Like she did not know how,  
She longed to see that seaport town  
Of Canadee-i-o.  
  
So she bargained with the sailor boy,  
All for a piece of gold.  
Straightaway then he led her  
Down into the hold,  
Sayin', ""I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes,  
Your jacket shall be blue.  
You'll see that seaport town  
Of Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when the other sailors heard the news,  
Well, they fell into a rage,  
And with all the ship's company  
They were willing to engage.  
Saying, ""We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys,  
Overboard we'll throw her.  
She'll never see that seaport town  
Called Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when the captain he heard the news,  
Well, he too fell in a rage,  
And with the whole ship's company  
He was willing to engage,  
Sayin', ""She'll stay in sailor's clothes,  
Her color shall be blue,  
She'll see that seaport town  
Call Canadee-i-o.  
  
Now, when they come down to Canada  
Scarcely 'bout half a year,  
She's married this bold captain  
Who called her his dear.  
She's dressed in silks and satins now,  
She cuts a gallant show,  
Finest of the ladies  
Down Canadee-i-o.  
  
Come, all you fair and tender girls,  
Wheresoever you may be,  
I'd have you to follow your own true love  
Whene'er he goes to sea.  
For if the sailors prove false to you,  
Well, the captain, he might prove true.  
You'll see the honor I have gained

Bob Dylan,Can't Wait,"I can't wait  
Wait for you to change my mind  
It's late

I'm your man  
I've tried to recover the sweet love that we knew  
  
You understand  
That my heart can't go on beating without you  
Well your loveliness has wounded me  
I'm reeling from the blow  
  
I wish I knew what it was that keeps me loving you so  
I'm breathin' hard standin' at the gate  
And I don't know how much longer I can wait  
Skies are gray  
  
I'm looking for anything that will bring a happy glow  
Night or day  
It doesn't matter where I go anymore I just go  
If I ever saw you comin' I don't know what I might do  
  
I'd like to think I could control myself  
But it isn't true  
That's how it is  
When things disintegrate  
  
And I don't know how much longer I can wait  
I'm doomed to love you  
I been rollin' through stormy weather  
I'm thinkin' of you  
  
And all the places we could roam together  
It's mighty funny  
The end of time has just begun  
Oh honey, after all these years you're still the one  
  
Well I'm strollin' through the lonely graveyard of my mind  
I left my life with you  
Somewhere back there along the line  
I thought somehow that I would be spared this day

Bob Dylan,Caribbean Wind,"She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost  
From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross.  
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy.  
Told about Jesus, told about the rain,  
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain  
By a man who danced on the roof of the embassy.  
  
Was she a child or a woman, I can't say which  
From one to another she could to easily switch  
We went into the wall to where the long arm of the law could not reach.  
Could I been used and played as a pawn?  
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on  
Where men bathed in perfume and celebrated free speech.  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,  
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.  
  
She looked into my soul through the clothes that I wore  
She said, ""We got a mutual friend over by the door,  
And you know he's got our best interest in mind.""  
He was well connected but her heart was a snare  
And she had left him to die in there,  
There were payments due and he was a little behind.  
  
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head,  
Ceiling fan broken, there's a heat in my bed,  
Street band playing ""Nearer My God to Thee.""  
We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring,  
She said, ""I know what you're thinking, but there ain't a thing  
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree.""  
  
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico  
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire  
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free,  
Bringing everything that's near to me nearer to the fire.  
  
Atlantic City by the cold grey sea  
I hear a voice crying, ""Daddy,"" I always think it's for me,  
But it's only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call.  
Every new messenger brings evil report  
'Bout armies on the march and time that is short  
And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls.  
  
Would I have married her? I don't know, I suppose.  
She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes  
But I kept hearing my name and I had to be movin' on.  
I saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin,  
I saw a house in the country being torn from within.  
I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond.

Bob Dylan,Catch The Wind,"In the chilly hours and minutes of uncertainty,  
I want to be in the warm heart of your loving mind.  
To feel you all around me,  
And to take your hand along the sand,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
When sundown pales the sky,  
I want to hide a while behind your smile,  
And everywhere I look your eyes I find.  
For me to love you now, would be the sweetest thing,  
T'would make me sing,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
When rain has hung the leaves with tears,  
I want you near, to kill my fears,  
To help me to leave all my blues behind.  
Standing in your heart is where I want to be  
And long to be,  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.  
  
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind.

Bob Dylan,Changing Of The Guards,"Sixteen years,  
Sixteen banners united over the field  
Where the good shepherd grieves.  
Desperate men, desperate women divided,  
Spreading their wings 'neath the falling leaves.  
  
Fortune calls.  
I stepped forth from the shadows, to the marketplace,  
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down.  
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born,  
On midsummer's eve, near the tower.  
  
The cold-blooded moon.  
The captain waits above the celebration  
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid  
Whose ebony face is beyond communication.  
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.  
  
They shaved her head.  
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo.  
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale.  
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow,  
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.  
  
I stumbled to my feet.  
I rode past destruction in the ditches  
With the stitches still mending 'neath a heart-shaped tattoo.  
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches  
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.  
  
The palace of mirrors  
Where dog soldiers are reflected,  
The endless road and the wailing of chimes,  
The empty rooms where her memory is protected,  
Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times.  
  
She wakes him up  
Forty-eight hours later, the sun is breaking  
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks.  
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking.  
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.  
  
Gentlemen, he said,  
I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes,  
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards  
But Eden is burning, either brace yourself for elimination  
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.  
  
Peace will come  
With tranquility and splendor on the wheels of fire  
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall  
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating  
Between the King and the Queen of Swords.

We have got to come together  
How long can we stay apart?  
You may get it maybe never  
But it's coming from the heart.  
  
Your life is full of indecision  
You can't make up your mind.  
We must get it in position

Yes the road is long, and it winds and winds  
When I think of the love that I left behind.  
  
Make me up a bed of roses  
And hang them down from the vine  
Of all my loves you've been the closest  
That's ever been on my mind.  
  
Please don't talk about tomorrow  
I'm really not one to care

Please, please give me indication  
Stop and talk to me  
Like a river that is flowing

You will always be my honey

Our love can't be bought with money

Bob Dylan,Covenant Woman,"Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord  
Way up yonder, great will be her reward.  
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star,  
I know I can trust you to stay where you are.  
  
And I just got to tell you  
I do intend  
To stay closer than any friend.  
I just got to thank you  
Once again  
For making your prayers known  
Unto heaven for me  
And to you, always, so grateful  
I will forever be.  
  
I've been broken, shattered like an empty cup.  
I'm just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up  
And I know He will do it 'cause He's faithful and He's true,  
He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you.  
  
And I just got to tell you  
I do intend  
To stay closer than any friend.  
I just got to thank you  
Once again  
For making your prayers known  
Unto heaven for me  
And to you, always, so grateful  
I will forever be.  
  
Covenant woman, intimate little girl  
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world.  
You know we are strangers in a land we're passing through.  
I'll always be right by your side, I've got a covenant too.  
  
And I just got to tell you

To stay closer than any friend.

Bob Dylan,'Cross The Green Mountain,"I cross the green mountain  
I sit by the stream  
Heaven blazing in my head  
I, I dreamt a monstrous dream  
  
Something came up  
Out of the sea  
Swept through the land of  
The rich and the free  
  
I look into the eyes  
Of my merciful friend  
And then I ask myself  
Is this the end?  
  
Memories linger  
Sad yet sweet  
And I think of the souls  
In heaven who will be  
  
Alters are burning  
The flames far and wide  
The fool has crossed over  
From the other side  
  
They tip their caps  
From the top of the hill  
You can feel them come  
All brave blood do spill  
  
Along the dim  
Atlantic line  
The rapper's land  
Lasts for miles behind  
  
The lights coming forward  
And the streets are broad  
All must yield  
To the avenging God  
  
The world is old  
The world is great  
Lessons of life  
Can't be learned in a day  
  
I watch and I wait  
And I listen while I stand  
To the music that comes  
From a far better land  
  
Close the eyes of our captain  
Peace may he know  
His long night is done  
The great leader is laid low  
  
He was ready to fall  
He was quick to defend  
Killed outright he was  
By his own men  
  
It's the last day's last hour  
Of the last happy year  
I feel that the unknown  
The world is so dear  
  
Pride will vanish  
And glory will rot  
But virtue lives  
And cannot be forgot  
  
The bells  
Of evening have rung  
There's blasphemy  
On the end of the tongue  
  
Let them say that I walked  
In fair nature's light  
And that I was loyal  
To truth and to right  
  
Serve God and meet your full  
Look upward beyond  
Beyond the darkness that masks  
The surprises of dawn  
  
In the deep green grasses  
And the blood stained woods  
They never dreamed of surrendering  
They fell where they stood  
  
Stars fell over Alabama  
I saw each star  
You're walking in dreams  
Whoever you are  
  
Chilled are the skies  
Keen is the frost  
The ground's froze hard  
And the morning is lost  
  
A letter to mother  
Came today  
Gunshot wound to the breast  
Is what it did say  
  
But he'll be better soon  
He's in a hospital bed  
But he'll never be better  
He's already dead  
  
I'm ten miles outside the city  
And I'm lifted away  
In an ancient light  
That is not of day

We knew them all too well

Bob Dylan,Day Of The Locusts,"Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration,  
The birdies were flying from tree to tree.  
There was little to say, there was no conversation  
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree.  
And the locusts sang off in the distance,  
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.  
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,  
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.  
  
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking,  
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb.  
I was ready to leave, I was already walkin',  
But the next time I looked there was light in the room.  
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill,  
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.  
Oh, the locusts sang their high whining trill,  
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me.  
  
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloadin',  
The weather was hot, a-nearly ninety degrees.  
The man standin' next to me, his head was exploding,  
Well, I was prayin' the pieces wouldn't fall on me.  
Yeah, the locusts sang off in the distance,  
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody.  
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance,  
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me.  
  
I put down my robe, picked up my diploma,  
Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive,  
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota,  
Sure was glad to get out of there alive.  
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill,

Bob Dylan,Days Of 49,"I'm old Tom Moore from the bummer's shore in that good old golden days  
They call me a bummer and a gin shot too, but what cares I for praise ?  
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign  
And all the people say, ""There goes Tom Moore, in the days of '49""  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
My comrades they all loved me well, a jolly saucy crew  
A few hard cases I will recall though they all were brave and true  
Whatever the pitch they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine  
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
There was New York Jake, the butcher boy, he was always getting tight  
And every time that he'd get full he was spoiling for a fight  
But Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein  
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game  
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same  
He would ante up and draw his cards and he would you go a hatful blind  
In the game with death Bill lost his breath, in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo, I never will forget  
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet  
One day he fell in a prospect hole, in a roaring bad design  
And in that hole he roared out his soul, in the days of '49  
In the days of old, in the days of gold  
How oft' times I repine for the days of old  
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49.  
  
Of the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast  
And I'm left alone in my misery like some poor wandering ghost  
And I pass by from town to town, they call me a rambling sign

Bob Dylan,Death Is Not The End,"When you're sad and lonely  
And you haven't got a friend

And all that you hell sacred  
Falls down and dows not bend  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
When you're standing at the cross-roads  
That you cannot comprehend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
And all your dreams have vanished  
And you don't know what's up the bend  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
When storm clouds gather round you  
And heavy rains descend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
And there's nowhere there to comfort you  
With a helping hand to lend  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end.  
  
Oh the tree of life is growing  
Where the spirit never dies  
And the bright light of salvation  
Shines in dark and empty skies  
  
When the cities are on fire  
When the burning flesh of men  
Just remember that death is nt the end  
And you search in vain to find  
  
Just one law abiding citizen  
Just remember that death is not the end.

Bob Dylan,Delia,"Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around,  
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down.

Delia's dear ol' mother took a trip out West,  
When she returned, little Delia gone to rest.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's momma moaned,  
Wouldn't have been so bad if the poor girl died at home.

Curtis' looking high, Curtis' looking low,  
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel forty-four.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
High up on the housetops, high as I can see,  
Looking for them rounders, looking out for me.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Men in Atlanta, tryin' to pass for white,  
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Judge says to Curtis, ""What's this noise about?""  
""All about them rounders, Judge, tryin' to cut me out.""  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Curtis said to the judge, ""What might be my fine?""  
Judge says, ""Poor boy, you got ninety-nine.""

All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Men in Atlanta, tryin' to pass for white,  
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Judge says to Curtis, ""What's this noise about?""  
""All about them rounders, Judge, tryin' to cut me out.""  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Curtis said to the judge, ""What might be my fine?""  
Judge says, ""Poor boy, you got ninety-nine.""  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Curtis' in the jail house, drinking from an old tin cup,  
Delia's in the graveyard, she ain't gettin' up.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?  
You loved all them rounders, never did love me.  
All the friends I ever had are gone.  
  
Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?  
You wanted all them rounders, never had time for me.  
All the friends I ever had are gone."
Bob Dylan,Desolation Row,"They're selling postcards of the hanging, they're painting  
the passports brown  
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors, the circus is in  
town  
Here comes the blind commissioner, they've got him in a  
trance  
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker, the other is in  
his pants  
And the riot squad they're restless, they need somewhere to  
go  
As Lady and I look out tonight, from Desolation Row  
  
Cinderella, she seems so easy, ""It takes one to know one,""  
she smiles  
And puts her hands in her back pockets Bette Davis style  
And in comes Romeo, he's moaning. ""You Belong to Me I  
Believe""  
And someone says, ""You're in the wrong place, my friend, you  
Better leave""  
And the only sound that's left after the ambulances go  
Is Cinderella sweeping up on Desolation Row  
  
Now the moon is almost hidden, the stars are beginning to  
hide  
The fortune telling lady has even taken all her things  
inside  
All except for Cain and Abel and the hunchback of Notre Dame  
  
Everybody is making love or else expecting rain  
And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing, he's getting ready  
for the show  
He's going to the carnival tonight on Desolation Row  
  
Now Ophelia, she's 'neath the window for her I feel so  
afraid  
On her twenty-second birthday she already is an old maid  
To her, death is quite romantic she wears an iron vest  
Her profession's her religion, her sin is her lifelessness  
And though her eyes are fixed upon Noah's great rainbow  
She spends her time peeking into Desolation Row  
  
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood with his memories in a  
trunk  
Passed this way an hour ago with his friend, a jealous monk  
He looked so immaculately frightful as he bummed a cigarette  
  
As he when off sniffing drainpipes and reciting the alphabet  
  
Now you would not think to look at him, but he was famous  
long ago  
For playing the electric violin on Desolation Row  
  
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world inside of a leather cup  
But all his sexless patients, they're trying to blow it up  
Now his nurse, some local loser, she's in charge of the  
cyanide hole  
And she also keeps the cards that read, ""Have Mercy on His  
Soul""  
They all play on the penny whistles, you can hear them blow  
If you lean your head out far enough from Desolation Row  
  
Across the street they've nailed the curtains, they're  
getting ready for the feast  
The Phantom of the Opera a perfect image of a priest  
They're spoon feeding Casanova to get him to feel more  
assured  
Then they'll kill him with self-confidence after poisoning  
him with words  
And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls, ""Get Outa Here  
If You Don't Know  
Casanova is just being punished for going to Desolation Row""  
  
Now at midnight all the agents and the superhuman crew  
Come out and round up everyone that knows more than they do  
Then they bring them to the factory where the heart-attack  
machine  
Is strapped across their shoulders and then the kerosene  
Is brought down from the castles by insurance men who go  
Check to see that nobody is escaping to Desolation Row  
  
Praise be to Nero's Neptune the Titanic sails at dawn  
And everybody's shouting, ""Which Side Are You On?""  
And Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the captain's  
tower  
While calypso singers laugh at them and fishermen hold  
flowers  
Between the windows of the sea where lovely mermaids flow  
And nobody has to think too much about Desolation row  
  
Yes, I received your letter yesterday (About the time the  
doorknob broke)  
When you asked me how I was doing, was that some kind of  
joke  
All these people that you mention, yes, I know them, they're  
quite lame  
I had to rearrange their faces and give them all another  
name  
Right now, I can't read too good, don't send me no more  
letters no  
Not unless you mail them from Desolation Row

Bob Dylan,Diamond Joe,"Now There's a man you'll hear about  
Most anywhere you go,  
And his holdings are in Texas  
And his name is Diamond Joe.  
  
And he carries all his money  
In a diamond-studded jar.  
He never took much trouble  
With the process of the law.  
  
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys,  
Did offer him my hand,  
He gave a string of horses  
So old they could not stand.  
  
And I nearly starved to death, boys,  
He did mistreat me so,  
And I never saved a dollar  
In the pay of Diamond Joe.  
  
Now his bread it was corn dodger  
And his meat you couldn't chaw,  
Nearly drove me crazy  
With the wagging of his jaw.  
  
And the telling of his story,  
Mean to let you know  
That there never was a rounder  
That could lie like Diamond Joe.  
  
Now, I tried three times to quit him,  
But he did argue so  
I'm still punching cattle  
In the pay of Diamond Joe.  
  
And when I'm called up yonder  
And it's my time to go,  
Give my blankets to my buddies  
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe.

Bob Dylan,Dink's Song,"If I had wings like Noah's dove  
I'd fly the river to the one I love  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
I had a man, who was long and tall,  
Moved his body like a cannon ball.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
'Member one evening, it was drizzling rain  
And in my heart I felt an aching pain.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
Once I wore my apron low,  
Been a-keep' you away from my door.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
Now my apron is up to my chin,  
You pass my door but you never come in.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
Muddy river runs muddy 'n' wild,  
You can't care the bloody for my unborn child.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
Number nine train ain' done no harm,  
Number nine train take my poor baby home.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.  
  
Fastest man I ever saw  
Skid Missouri on the way to Arkansas.  
Fare thee well, my honey, fare thee well.

Bob Dylan,Dirge,"I hate myself for lovin' you and the weakness that it showed  
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road.  
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel,  
I hate myself for lovin' you and I'm glad the curtain fell.  
  
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed  
And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?  
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within,  
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin.  
  
Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped,  
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped.  
Like a slave in orbit, he's beaten 'til he's tame,  
All for a moment's glory and it's a dirty, rotten shame.  
  
There are those who worship loneliness, I'm not one of them,  
In this age of fiberglass I'm searching for a gem.  
The crystal ball up on the wall hasn't shown me nothing yet,  
I've paid the price of solitude, but at last I'm out of debt.  
  
Can't recall a useful thing you ever did for me  
'Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees.  
We stared into each other's eyes 'til one of us would break,  
No use to apologize, what diff'rence would it make?  
  
So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine,  
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.  
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I'm at,  
I hate myself for lovin' you, but I should get over that.

A-lookin' around just to see who's born  
I found a little chicken down on his knees  
I went up and yelled to him  
""Please, please, please""  
He said, ""Don't ya tell Henry  
Don't ya tell Henry

I's lookin' around, I wouldn't say when  
I looked down low, I looked above  
And who did I see but the one I love  
She said, ""Don't ya tell Henry

A-lookin' around just to see myself  
I spotted a horse and a donkey too  
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few  
The said, ""Don't ya tell Henry

And we'll leave this ol' highway behind.  
  
Well, the ocean took my baby,  
My baby stole my heart from me.  
Yes, the ocean took my baby,  
My baby took my heart from me.  
She packed it all up in a suitcase,  
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy.  
  
So, I'm a-walkin' down your highway  
Just as far as my poor eyes can see.  
Yes, I'm a-walkin' down your highway  
Just as far as my eyes can see.  
From the Golden Gate Bridge  
All the way to the Statue of Liberty."
Bob Dylan,Dreamin' Of You,"The light  
In this place  
Is really bad  
Like being  
In the bottom  
Of a stream  
Any minute now  
I'm expecting  
To wake up  
From a dream  
Miss so much  
The softest touch  
Like the grave  
Of some child child  
Who neither wept  
Nor smiled  
I'm hiding my faith  
In the rain  
I've been  
Dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
And it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Somewhere dawn  
Is breaking  
Light is streaking  
Across the floor  
Church bells  
Are ringing  
I wonder who  
They're ringing for  
Travel under any star  
You'll see me  
Wherever you are  
  
The shadowy past  
Is so vague and so vast  
I'm sleeping  
In the balance of pain  
I've been dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Maybe they'll get me  
Maybe they won't  
But whatever  
It won't be tonight  
I wish your hand  
Was in mine right now  
We could go  
Where the moon is wide  
  
For years  
They had me  
Locked in a cage  
Then they threw me  
Onto the stage  
Somethings  
Just last longer  
Then you  
Thought they would  
And they never  
Ever explain  
I'm dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
And it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Well  
I eat when I'm hungry  
Drink when I'm dry  
Live my life  
On the square  
Even if the flesh  
Falls off my face  
It won't matter as long  
As you're there  
  
Feel like  
A ghost in love  
Underneath  
The heavens above  
Feel further away  
Then I ever did before  
Feel further  
Than I can take  
Dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane  
  
Everything in the way  
Is so shy like the day  
In queer and unusual form  
Spirals of golden haze here  
In there in a blaze  
Like beams of light  
In a star  
  
Maybe you're here  
Or maybe you weren't  
Maybe you  
Touched somebody  
And got burned  
The silent sun  
Has got me on the run  
Burning a hole  
In my brain  
I'm dreamin' of you  
That's all I do  
But it's  
Driving me insane

Bob Dylan,Driftin' Too Far From Shore,"I didn't know that you'd be leavin'  
Or who you thought you were talkin' to.  
I figure maybe we're even  
Or maybe I'm one up on you.  
  
I send you all my money

No gentleman likes making love to a servant.  
Especially when he's in his father's house.

Never needed to call you my whore.

I waited years sometimes for what I wanted.  
Everybody can't be as lucky as you.

At any moment you could go under,

I give you all of what I could provide  
We weren't on the wrong side, sweetness,  
We were the wrong side.  
  
I've already ripped out the phones, honey.  
You can't walk the streets in a war.  
I can finish this alone, honey,  
You're driftin' too far from shore.

Bob Dylan,Duquesne Whistle,"Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing  
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away

You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp  
But I ain't neither one

You're like a time bomb in my heart  
  
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling  
Must be the mother of our Lord

Blowing like my woman's on board

Blowing through another no good town  
  
The lights on my native land are glowing  
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round  
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing  
That old oak tree, the one we used to climb

Bob Dylan,Early Morning Rain,"In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand  
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand  
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so  
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go.  
  
Cut on runway number nine, big 707 set to go  
I'm stuck here on the ground, where the cold winds blow  
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast  
There she goes, my friend, she's rolling down at last.  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high  
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly  
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines  
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time.  
  
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me  
Because I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunks as I might be  
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train  
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain.

Bob Dylan,Early Roman Kings,"All the early Roman kings  
In their sharkskin suits  
Bow ties and buttons  
High top boots  
Drivin' the spikes in  
Blazin' the rails  
Nailed in their coffins  
In top hats and tails  
  
Fly away, little bird  
Fly away, flap your wings  
Fly by night  
Like the early Roman kings  
  
All the early Roman kings  
In the early, early morn  
Coming down the mountain  
Distributing the corn  
Speeding through the forest  
Racing down the track  
You try to get away  
They drag you back  
  
Tomorrow is Friday  
We'll see what it brings  
Everybody's talking  
'Bout the early Roman kings  
  
They're peddlers and they're meddlers  
They buy and they sell  
They destroyed your city  
They'll destroy you as well  
They're lecherous and treacherous  
Hell-bent for leather  
Each of 'em bigger  
Than all men put together  
  
Sluggers and muggers  
Wearing fancy gold rings  
All the women goin' crazy  
For the early Roman kings  
  
I can dress up your wounds  
With a blood-clotted rag  
I ain't afraid to make love  
To a bitch or a hag  
If you see me comin'  
And you're standing there  
Wave your handkerchief  
In the air  
  
I ain't dead yet  
My bell still rings  
I keep my fingers crossed  
Like them early Roman kings  
  
I can strip you of life  
Strip you of breath  
Ship you down  
To the house of death  
One day  
You will ask for me  
There'll be no one else  
That you'll wanna see  
  
Bring down my fiddle  
Tune up my strings  
I'm gonna break it wide open  
Like the early Roman kings  
  
I was up on black mountain  
The day Detroit fell  
They killed 'em all off  
And they sent 'em to hell  
Ding dong daddy  
You're coming up short  
Gonna put you on trial  
In a Sicilian court  
  
I've had my fun  
I've had my flings  
Gonna shake 'em all down  
Like the early Roman kings

Bob Dylan,Endless Highway,"Take a silver dollar and put it in your pocket,  
Never let it slip away.  
Always be a man, not a boy gone astray.  
When ya get half cra-zy from the August heat  
Or on a frozen, rotted road  
With no one to complain to about your achin' feet.  
  
[Chorus:]  
You're gonna walk that endless highway,  
Walk that high-way till you die.  
All you children goin' my way,  
Better tell your home-life sweet goodbye.  
  
When I see a detour up ahead,  
Well, I leave it far behind,  
Who knows what you're apt to find there.  
With the cost of livin, and the price of dyin',  
Well it look like t'me this time I wont be buyin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When they get a scapegoat by the throat,  
it's hard labour and cold beans.  
If ya get away real quick,  
You'll be eatin from the poison peanut machine.  
Well, I sing by night, wander by day.  
I'm on the road and it looks like I'm here to stay.

Bob Dylan,Eternal Circle,"I sang the song slowly  
As she stood in the shadows  
She stepped to the light  
As my silver strings spun  
She called with her eyes  
To the tune I's a-playin'  
But the song it was long  
And I'd only begun  
  
Through a bullet of light  
Her face was reflectin'  
The fast fading words  
That rolled from my tongue  
With a long-distance look  
Her eyes was on fire  
But the song it was long  
And there was more to be sung.  
  
My eyes danced a circle  
Across her clear outline  
With her head tilted sideways  
She called me again  
As the tune drifted out  
She breathed hard through the echo  
But the song it was long  
And it was far to the end  
  
I glanced at my guitar  
And played it pretendin'  
That of all the eyes out there  
I could see none  
As her thoughts pounded hard  
Like the pierce of an arrow  
But the song it was long  
And it had to get done  
  
As the tune finally folded  
I laid down the guitar  
Then looked for the girl  
Who'd stayed for so long  
But her shadow was missin'  
For all of my searchin'  
So I picked up my guitar  
And began the next song

Bob Dylan,Eve Of Destruction,"The eastern world it is explodin'  
Violence flarin', bullets loadin'  
You're old enough to kill but not for votin'  
You don't believe in war, what's that gun you're totin'  
And even the Jordan river has bodies floatin'  
  
But you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
  
Don't you understand, what I'm trying to say?  
Can't you feel the fears that I'm feeling today?  
If the button is pushed, there's no running away  
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave  
Take a look around you, boy, it's bound to scare you, boy  
  
And you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
  
Yeah, my blood's so mad, feels like coagulatin'  
I'm sittin' here, just contemplatin'  
I can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation  
Handful of Senators don't pass legislation  
And marches alone can't bring integration  
When human respect is disintegratin'  
This whole crazy world is just too frustratin'  
  
And you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
  
Think of all the hate there is in Red China  
Then take a look around to Selma, Alabama  
Ah, you may leave here, for four days in space  
But when your return, it's the same old place  
The poundin' of the drums, the pride and disgrace  
You can bury your dead, but don't leave a trace  
Hate your next-door-neighbor, but don't forget to say grace  
  
And you tell me over and over and over and over again my friend  
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
You don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

","The eastern world it is explodin'  
Violence flarin', bullets loadin'  
You're old enough to kill but not for votin'  
You don't believe in war, what's that gun you're totin'  
And even the Jordan river has bodies floatin'  
  
But you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
  
Don't you understand, what I'm trying to say?  
Can't you feel the fears that I'm feeling today?  
If the button is pushed, there's no running away  
There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave  
Take a look around you, boy, it's bound to scare you, boy  
  
And you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction  
  
Yeah, my blood's so mad, feels like coagulatin'  
I'm sittin' here, just contemplatin'  
I can't twist the truth, it knows no regulation  
Handful of Senators don't pass legislation  
And marches alone can't bring integration  
When human respect is disintegratin'  
This whole crazy world is just too frustratin'  
  
And you tell me over and over and over again my friend  
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction

Bob Dylan,Every Grain Of Sand,"In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need  
When the pool of tears beneath my feet floods every newborn seed  
There's a dying voice within me reaching out somewhere  
Toiling in the danger and the morals of despair  
  
Don't have the inclination to look back on any mistake  
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break  
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master's hand  
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand  
  
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear  
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer  
The sun beams down upon the steps of time to light the way  
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay  
  
I gaze into the doorway of temptation's angry flame  
And every time I pass that way I'll always hear my name  
Then onward in my journey I come to understand  
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand  
  
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night  
In the violence of a summer's dream, in the chill of a wintry light  
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space  
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face  
  
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea  
Sometimes I turn, there's someone there, other times it's only me  
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man  
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand

Bob Dylan,Everything Is Broken,"Broken lines, broken strings,  
Broken threads, broken springs,  
Broken idols, broken heads,  
People sleeping in broken beds.  
Ain't no use jiving  
Ain't no use joking  
Everything is broken.  
  
Broken bottles, broken plates,  
Broken switches, broken gates,  
Broken dishes, broken parts,  
Streets are filled with broken hearts.  
Broken words never meant to be spoken,  
Everything is broken.  
  
Bridge: Seem like every time you stop and turn around  
Something else just hit the ground  
  
Broken cutters, broken saws,  
Broken buckles, broken laws,  
Broken bodies, broken bones,  
Broken voices on broken phones.  
Take a deep breath, feel like you're chokin',  
Everything is broken.  
  
Bridge: Every time you leave and go off someplace  
Things fall to pieces in my face  
  
Broken hands on broken ploughs,  
Broken treaties, broken vows,  
Broken pipes, broken tools,  
People bending broken rules.  
Hound dog howling, bull frog croaking,  
Everything is broken.

Bob Dylan,Farewell,"Oh it's fare thee well my darlin' true,  
I'm leavin' in the first hour of the morn.  
I'm bound off for the bay of Mexico  
Or maybe the coast of Californ.  
So it's fare thee well my own true love,  
We'll meet another day, another time.  
It ain't the leavin'  
That's a-grievin' me  
But my true love who's bound to stay behind.  
  
Oh the weather is against me and the wind blows hard  
And the rain she's a-turnin' into hail.  
I still might strike it lucky on a highway goin' west,  
Though I'm travelin' on a path beaten trail.

We'll meet another day, another time.

I will tell you of the laughter and of troubles,  
Be them somebody else's or my own.

Bob Dylan,Farewell Angelina,"Farewell Angelina  
The bells of the crown  
Are being stolen by bandits  
I must follow the sound  
The triangle tingles  
And the trumpet play slow  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is on fire  
And I must go.  
  
There's no need for anger  
There's no need for blame  
There's nothing to prove  
Ev'rything's still the same  
Just a table standing empty  
By the edge of the sea  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is trembling  
And I must leave.  
  
The jacks and queens  
Have forsaked the courtyard  
Fifty-two gypsies  
Now file past the guards  
In the space where the deuce  
And the ace once ran wild  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is folding  
I'll see you in a while.  
  
See the cross-eyed pirates sitting  
Perched in the sun  
Shooting tin cans  
With a sawed-off shotgun  
And the neighbors they clap  
And they cheer with each blast  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky's changing color  
And I must leave fast.  
  
King Kong, little elves  
On the rooftoops they dance  
Valentino-type tangos  
While the make-up man's hands  
Shut the eyes of the dead  
Not to embarrass anyone  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is embarrassed  
And I must be gone.  
  
The machine guns are roaring  
The puppets heave rocks  
The fiends nail time bombs  
To the hands of the clocks  
Call me any name you like  
I will never deny it  
Farewell Angelina  
The sky is erupting  
I must go where it's quiet.

Father of love and Father of rain.

Bob Dylan,Folsom Prison Blues,"I hear that train a-rolling, it's a-rolling round the bend  
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when  
I'm stucked in Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on  
And I hear that whistle blowing all down to San Antone  
  
When I was just a baby my momma told me: son  
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns  
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die  
When I hear that train a-pulling I hang my head and cry  
  
I bet there's rich folks eating in their fancy dining cars  
They're probably drinking coffee and smoking big cigars  
But I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free  
But the people keep a-moving, and that's what tortures me  
  
If they'd free me from this prison, if that railroad train was mine  
You bet I moved it on a little further down the line  
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I long to stay  
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

Bob Dylan,Foot Of Pride,"Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man  
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male  
They sang ""Danny Boy"" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer  
Preacher talking 'bout Christ betrayed  
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up  
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground  
You know what they say about bein' nice to the right people on the way up  
Sooner or later you gonna meet them comin' down  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Hear ya got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names  
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed  
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine  
But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed  
Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger  
And your fall by the sword love affair with Erroll Flynn  
In these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion  
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
There's a retired businessman named Red, cast down from heaven and he's out of
his head  
He feeds off of everyone that he can touch  
He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash  
He's not somebody that you play around with much  
Miss Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is  
She'll do wondrous works with your fate  
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in your bed  
If you don't mind sleepin' with your head face down in a grave.  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Well they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight  
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors  
How to enter into the gates of paradise  
No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours  
Yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks  
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks  
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in  
Sing ""Amazing Grace"" all the way to the Swiss banks  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
They got some beautiful people out there, man  
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue  
They got mystery written all over their forehead  
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young  
They don't believe in mercy  
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see  
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route  
Turn you into anything that they want you to be  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Yes, I guess I loved him too  
I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill  
Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped  
Struck down by the strength of the will  
Ain't nothin' left here partner, just the dust of a plague that has left this
whole town afraid  
From now on, this'll be where you're from  
Let the dead bury the dead. Your time will come  
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade

May you have a strong foundation  
When the winds of changes shift  
May your heart always be joyful  
And may your song always be sung  
May you stay forever young  
Forever young, forever young  
May you stay forever young."
Bob Dylan,Forgetful Heart,"Forgetful heart  
Lost your power of recall  
Every little detail  
You don't remember at all  
The times we knew  
Who would remember better than you?  
  
Forgetful heart  
We laughed and had a good time, you and I  
It's been so long  
Now you're content to let the days go by  
When you were there  
You were the answer to my prayer  
  
Forgetful heart  
We loved with all the love that life can give  
What can I say?  
Without you it's so hard to live  
Can't take much more  
Why can't we love like we did before?  
  
Forgetful heart  
Like a walking shadow in my brain  
All night long  
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain  
The door has closed forevermore  
If indeed there ever was a door

Bob Dylan,From A Buick 6,"I got this graveyard woman, you know she keeps my kids  
But my soulful mama, you know she keeps me hid  
She's a junkyard angel and she always gives me the bread  
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed  
  
Well, when the pipeline gets broken and I'm lost on the river bridge  
I'm all cracked up on the highway and in the water's edge  
And then she comes down the thruway, ready to sew me up with a thread  
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed  
  
Well, she don't make me nervous, she don't talk too much  
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don't need no crutch  
She keeps this four-ten all loaded with lead  
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed  
  
Well, you know I need a steam shovel, mama, to keep away the dead  
I need a dump truck, baby, to unload my head  
She brings me everything and more, and just like I said  
Well, if I go down dyin', you know she's bound to put a blanket on my bed

Bob Dylan,Full Moon And Empty Arms,"Full moon and empty arms  
The moon is there for us to share  
But where are you?  
  
A night like this  
Could weave a memory  
And every kiss  
Could start a dream for two  
  
Full moon and empty arms  
Tonight I'll use the magic moon to wish upon  
And next full moon  
If my one wish comes true  
My empty arms will be filled with you

Bob Dylan,Gates Of Eden,"Of war and peace the truth just twists  
Its curfew gull just glides  
Upon four-legged forest clouds  
The cowboy angel rides  
With his candle lit into the sun  
Though its glow is waxed in black  
All except when 'neath the trees of Eden  
  
The lamppost stands with folded arms  
Its iron claws attached  
To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail  
Though it shadows metal badge  
All and all can only fall  
With a crashing but meaningless blow  
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden  
  
The savage soldier sticks his head in sand  
And then complains  
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf  
But still remains  
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay  
At ships with tattooed sails  
Heading for the Gates of Eden  
  
With a time-rusted compass blade  
Aladdin and his lamp  
Sits with Utopian hermit monks  
Side saddle on the Golden Calf  
And on their promises of paradise  
You will not hear a laugh  
All except inside the Gates of Eden  
  
Relationships of ownership  
They whisper in the wings  
To those condemned to act accordingly  
And wait for succeeding kings  
And I try to harmonize with songs  
The lonesome sparrow sings  
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The motorcycle black Madonna  
Two-wheeled gypsy queen  
And her silver-studded phantom cause  
The gray flannel dwarf to scream  
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey  
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins  
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The kingdoms of experience  
In the precious wind they rot  
While paupers change possessions  
Each one wishing for what the other has got  
And the princess and the prince  
Discuss what's real and what is not  
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden  
  
The foreign sun, it squints upon  
A bed that is never mine  
As friends and other strangers  
From their fates try to resign  
Leaving men wholly, totally free  
To do anything they wish to do but die  
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden  
  
At dawn my lover comes to me  
And tells me of her dreams  
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse  
Into the ditch of what each one means  
At times I think there are no words  
But these to tell what's true  
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

Because he was just too real.

They cut George Jackson down.  
Lord, Lord,  
They laid him in the ground.

As they watched him from above

They were scared of his love.

So they cut George Jackson down.

I've got my mind made up.  
  
You will be alright girl  
Someone's watching over you  
He won't do nothing to you  
Baby that I wouldn't do  
Well if you don't want to see me  
Look the other way  
You don't have to feed me  
I ain't your dog that's gone astray  
I've got my mind made up  
I've got my mind made up.  
I've got my mind made up  
I've got my mind made up.  
I've got my mind made up."

Bob Dylan,Hard Times,"Let us pause in life's pleasures and count its many tears  
While we all sup sorrow with the poor.  
There's a song that will linger forever in our ears,  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.  
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.  
Oh, hard times, come again no more.  
  
While we seek mirth and beauty and music light and gay.  
There are frail forms fainting at the door.  
Though their voices are silent, their pleading looks will say.

'Tis the song, the sigh of the weary.  
Hard times, hard times, come again no more.  
Many days you have lingered all around my cabin door.

Sing it to you right, but you might think it's wrong.

'Bout an east coast city that you all know well.  
  
It's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Old new york city is a friendly old town,  
From Washington heights to Harlem on down.  
There's a-mighty many people all millin' all around,  
They'll kick you when you're up and knock you when you're down.  
  
It's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
It's a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate  
To Rockefeller plaza n' the Empire State.  
Mister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird,  
Old mister empire never says a word.  
  
It's hard times from the country,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Well, it's up in the mornin' tryin' to fins a job of work.  
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt.  
If you go a lot o' money you can make yourself merry,  
If you only got a nickel, it's the Staten island ferry.  
  
And it's hard times in the city,  
Livin' down in New York town.  
  
Mister Hudson come a-sailin' down the stream  
And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream.  
Bought your city on a one-way track,

'N every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains,  
'N the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines.

Bob Dylan,Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,"Have yourself  
A merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
  
Next year  
Our troubles  
Will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself  
A merry little Christmas  
Make the Yule-tide gay  
Next year  
Our troubles  
Will be miles away  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends  
Who are dear to us  
Will be near to us once more  
  
Someday soon  
We all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Until then we'll  
Have to motor through somehow  
And have yourself  
A merry little Christmas now

Bob Dylan,Hazel,"Hazel, dirty-blonde hair  
I wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with you anywhere.  
You got something I want plenty of  
Ooh, a little touch of your love.  
  
Hazel, stardust in your eye  
You're goin' somewhere and so am I.  
I'd give you the sky high above  
Ooh, for a little touch of your love.  
  
Oh no, I don't need any reminder  
To know how much I really care  
But it's just making me blinder and blinder  
Because I'm up on a hill and still you're not there.  
  
Hazel, you called and I came,  
Now don't make me play this waiting game.  
You've got something I want plenty of  
Ooh, a little touch of your love.

Abe said, ""Man, you must be puttin' me on""  
God said, ""No"" Abe say, ""What?""  
God say, ""You can do what you want, Abe, but  
The next time you see me comin', you better run""  
Well, Abe said, ""Where d'you want this killin' done?""  
God said, ""Out on Highway 61""  
  
Well, Georgia Sam, he had a bloody nose  
Welfare department, they wouldn't give him no clothes  
He asked poor Howard, ""Where can I go?""  
Howard said, ""There's only one place I know""  
Sam said, ""Tell me quick, man, I got to run""  
Oh, Howard just pointed with his gun  
And said, ""That way, down Highway 61""  
  
Well, Mack the Finger said to Louie the King  
""I got forty red-white-and-blue shoestrings  
And a thousand telephones that don't ring  
Do you know where I can get rid of these things?""  
And Louie the King said, ""Let me think for a minute, son""  
Then he said, ""Yes, I think it can be easily done  
Just take everything down to Highway 61""  
  
Now, the fifth daughter on the twelfth night  
Told the first father that things weren't right  
""My complexion,"" she says, ""is much too white""  
He said, ""Come here and step into the light""  
He said, ""Hmm, you're right, let me tell the second mother this has been done""  
But the second mother was with the seventh son  
And they were both out on Highway 61  
  
Now, the roving gambler he was very bored  
Trying to create a next world war  
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor  
He said, ""I never engaged in this kind of thing before  
But yes, I think it can be very easily done  
We'll just put some bleachers out in the sun  
And have it on Highway 61""

Honey, just allow me one more chance,  
Ah'll do anything with you.  
Well, lookin' for a woman  
That ain't got no man,  
Is just lookin' for a needle  
That is lost in the sand.  
Just-a one kind favor I ask you,  
'Low me just-a one more chance."
Bob Dylan,House Of The Rising Sun,"There is a house down in New Orleans  
They call the rising sun  
And it's been the ruin of many poor girl  
And me, oh God, I'm one.  
  
My mother was a tailor  
She sowed these new blue jeans  
My sweetheart was a gambler, Lord  
Down in New Orleans.  
  
Now the only thing a gambler needs  
Is a suitcase and a trunk  
And the only time he's satisfied  
Is when he's on a drunk.  
  
He fills his glasses up to the brim  
And he'll pass the cards around  
And the only pleasure he gets out of life  
Is rambling from town to town.  
  
Oh tell my baby sister  
Not to do what I have done  
But shun that house in New Orleans  
They call the rising sun.  
  
Well it's one foot on the platform  
And the other foot on the train  
I'm going back to New Orleans  
To wear that ball and chain.  
  
I'm going back to New Orleans  
My race is almost run  
I'm going back to end my life  
Down in the rising sun.  
  
There is a house in New Orleans  
They call the rising sun  
It's been the ruin of many poor girl  
And me, oh God, I'm one.

Bob Dylan,Huck's Tune,"Well I wandered alone,  
Through a desert of stone,  
And I dreamed of my future wife.  
My sword's in my hand,  
And I'm next in command,  
In this version of Death called Life.  
My plate and my cup,  
Are right straight up,  
I took a rose from the hand of a child.  
When I kiss your lips,  
The honey drips,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
Every day we meet,  
On any old street,  
And you're in your girlish prime.  
The short and the tall,  
Are coming to the ball,  
I go there all the time.  
Behind every tree,  
There's something to see,  
The river is wider than a mile.  
I tried you twice,  
You can't be nice,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
Here come the nurse,  
With money in her purse,  
Here come the ladies and men.  
You push it all in,  
And you've no chance to win,  
You play 'em on down to the end.  
I'm laying in the sand,  
Getting a sunshine tan,  
Moving along, riding in style.  
From my toes to my head,  
You knock me dead,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
I count the years,  
And I shed no tears,  
I'm blinded to what might have been.  
Nature's voice,  
Makes my heart rejoice,  
Play me the wild song of the wind.  
I found hopeless love,  
In the room above,  
When the sun and the weather were riled.  
You're as fine as wine,  
I ain't handing you no line,  
I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.  
  
All the merry little elves,  
Can go hang themselves,  
My faith is as cold as can be.  
I'm stacked high to the roof,  
And I'm not without proof,  
If you don't believe me, come see.  
You think I'm blue,  
I think so, too,  
In my words you'll find no guile.  
The game's gotten old,  
The deck's gone cold,  
And I'm gonna have to put you down for a while.

Bob Dylan,I And I,"Been so long since a strange woman has slept in my bed  
Look how sweet she sleeps, how free must be her dreams  
In another lifetime she must have owned the world, or been faithfully wed  
To some righteous king who wrote psalms beside moonlit streams.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Think I'll go out and go for a walk  
Not much happening here, nothing ever does  
Besides, if she wakes up now, she'll just want to talk  
I got nothing to say, 'specially about whatever it was.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man see my face and lives.  
  
Took an untrodden path once, where the swift don't win the race  
It goes to the worthy, who can divide the word of truth  
Took a stranger to teach me, to look into justice's beautiful face  
And see an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Outside of two men on a train platform there's nothing in sight  
They're waiting for spring to come, smoking down the trck  
The world could come to an end tonight, bt that's all right  
She could still be there sleeping when I get back.  
  
I and I  
In creation where one's nature neither honors nor forgives  
I and I  
One say to the other, no man sees my face and lives.  
  
Noontime, and I'm still pushing myself along the road, the darkest part  
Into the narrow lanes, I can't stumble or stay put  
Someone else is speaking with my mouth, but I'm listening with my heart  
I've made shoes for everyone, even you, while I go barefoot.

Bob Dylan,I Don't Believe You,"I can't understand, she let go of my hand  
An' left me here facing the wall  
I'd sure like to know, why she did go  
But I can't get close to her at all  
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime  
She said she would never forget  
But now morning is clear, it's like I ain't here  
She acts like we never met  
It's all new to me like some mystery  
It could even be like a myth  
Yet it's hard to think on that she's the same one  
That last night I was with  
From darkness, dreams are deserted  
Am I still dreamin' yet?  
I wish she'd unlock her voice once an' talk  
'Stead of acting like we never met  
If she ain't feelin' well then why don't she tell  
'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?  
Without any doubt, she seems too far out  
For me to return to her chase  
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played  
Her mouth was watery and wet  
But now something has changed for she ain't the same  
She just acts like we never have met  
If I didn't have to guess, I'd gladly confess  
To anything I might've tried  
If I was with her too long or have done something wrong  
I'd wish she'd tell me what it is, I'll run an' hide  
Though the night ran swirling an' whirling

But if you want me to, I can be just like you  
An' pretend that we never have touched

Bob Dylan,I Dreamed I Saw St. Augustine,"I dreamed I saw St. Augustine  
Alive as you or me  
Tearing through these quarters  
In the utmost misery  
With a blanket underneath his arm  
And a coat of solid gold  
Searching for the very souls  
Whom already have been sold.  
  
""Arise, arise"", he cried so loud  
With a voice without restraint  
""Come out ye gifted kings and queens  
And hear my sad complaint  
No martyr is among ye now  
Whom you can call your own  
So go on your way accordingly  
But know you're not alone"".  
  
I dreamed I saw St. Augustine  
Alive with fiery breath  
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones  
That put him out to death  
Oh, I awoke in anger  
So alone and terrified  
I put my fingers against the glass  
And bowed my head and cried.

Bob Dylan,I Pity The Poor Immigrant,"I pity the poor immigrant  
Who wishes he would've stayed home,  
Who uses all his power to do evil  
But in the end is always left so alone.  
That man whom with his fingers cheats  
And who lies with ev'ry breath,  
Who passionately hates his life  
And likewise, fears his death.  
  
I pity the poor immigrant  
Whose strength is spent in vain,  
Whose heaven is like Ironsides,  
Whose tears are like rain,  
Who eats but is not satisfied,  
Who hears but does not see,  
Who falls in love with wealth itself  
And turns his back on me.  
  
I pity the poor immigrant  
Who tramples through the mud,  
Who fills his mouth with laughing  
And who builds his town with blood,  
Whose visions in the final end  
Must shatter like the glass.  
I pity the poor immigrant  
When his gladness comes to pass.

Bob Dylan,I Shall Be Free,"Well, I took me a woman late last night,  
I's three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight.  
She took off her wheel, took off her bell,  
Took off her wig, said, ""How do I smell?""  
I hot-footed it, bare-naked  
Out the window!  
  
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,  
Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk.  
Don't hurt me none, don't hurt my pride  
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.  
(Right there  
Proud as can be)  
  
I's out there paintin' on the old woodshed  
When a can a black paint it fell on my head.  
I went down to scrub and rub  
But I had to sit in back of the tub.  
Cost a quarter  
And I had to get out quick  
Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna  
  
Well, my telephone rang it would not stop,  
It's President Kennedy callin' me up.  
He said, ""My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?""  
I said, ""My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,  
Anita Ekberg,  
Sophia Loren.""  
Put 'em all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine!  
  
Well, I got a woman sleeps on a cot,  
She yells and hollers and squeals a lot.  
Licks my face and tickles my ear,  
Bends me over and buys me beer.  
(She's a honeymooner  
A June crooner  
A spoon feeder  
And a natural leader)  
  
Oh, there ain't no use in me workin' so heavy,  
I got a woman who works on the levee.  
Pumping that water up to her neck,  
Every week she sends me a monthly check.  
She's a humdinger  
Folk singer  
Dead ringer  
For a thing-a-muh jigger  
  
Late one day in the middle of the week,  
Eyes were closed I was half asleep.  
I chased me a woman up the hill,  
Right in the middle of an air raid drill.  
It was Little Bo Peep!  
(I jumped a fallout shelter  
I jumped a bean stalk  
I jumped a Ferris wheel)  
  
Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote,  
He's a-runnin' for office on the ballot note.  
He's out there preachin' in front of the steeple,  
Tellin' me he loves all kinds-a people.  
(He's eatin' bagels  
He's eatin' pizza  
He's eatin' chitlins  
He's eatin' bullshit!)  
  
Oh, set me down on a television floor,  
I'll flip the channel to number four.  
Out of the shower comes a grown-up man  
With a bottle of hair oil in his hand.  
(It's that greasy kid stuff.  
What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is  
What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner,  
Charles de Gaulle  
And Robert Louis Stevenson?)  
  
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen  
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.  
She takes about fifteen baths a day,  
Wants me to grow a cigar on my face.  
(She's a little bit heavy!)  
  
Well, ask me why I'm drunk alla time,  
It levels my head and eases my mind.  
I just walk along and stroll and sing,  
I see better days and I do better things.  
I catch dinosaurs  
I make love to Elizabeth Taylor  
Catch hell from Richard Burton!)

","Well, I took me a woman late last night,  
I's three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight.  
She took off her wheel, took off her bell,  
Took off her wig, said, ""How do I smell?""  
I hot-footed it, bare-naked  
Out the window!  
  
Well, sometimes I might get drunk,  
Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk.  
Don't hurt me none, don't hurt my pride  
'Cause I got my little lady right by my side.  
(Right there  
Proud as can be)  
  
I's out there paintin' on the old woodshed  
When a can a black paint it fell on my head.  
I went down to scrub and rub  
But I had to sit in back of the tub.  
Cost a quarter  
And I had to get out quick  
Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna  
  
Well, my telephone rang it would not stop,  
It's President Kennedy callin' me up.  
He said, ""My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?""  
I said, ""My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot,  
Anita Ekberg,  
Sophia Loren.""  
Put 'em all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine!  
  
Well, I got a woman sleeps on a cot,  
She yells and hollers and squeals a lot.  
Licks my face and tickles my ear,  
Bends me over and buys me beer.  
(She's a honeymooner  
A June crooner  
A spoon feeder  
And a natural leader)  
  
Oh, there ain't no use in me workin' so heavy,  
I got a woman who works on the levee.  
Pumping that water up to her neck,  
Every week she sends me a monthly check.  
She's a humdinger  
Folk singer  
Dead ringer  
For a thing-a-muh jigger  
  
Late one day in the middle of the week,  
Eyes were closed I was half asleep.  
I chased me a woman up the hill,  
Right in the middle of an air raid drill.  
It was Little Bo Peep!  
(I jumped a fallout shelter  
I jumped a bean stalk  
I jumped a Ferris wheel)  
  
Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote,  
He's a-runnin' for office on the ballot note.  
He's out there preachin' in front of the steeple,  
Tellin' me he loves all kinds-a people.  
(He's eatin' bagels  
He's eatin' pizza  
He's eatin' chitlins  
He's eatin' bullshit!)  
  
Oh, set me down on a television floor,  
I'll flip the channel to number four.  
Out of the shower comes a grown-up man  
With a bottle of hair oil in his hand.  
(It's that greasy kid stuff.  
What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is  
What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner,  
Charles de Gaulle  
And Robert Louis Stevenson?)  
  
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen  
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean.

Wants me to grow a cigar on my face.

Bob Dylan,I Shall Be Free No. 10,"I'm just average, common too  
I'm just like him, the same as you  
I'm everybody's brother and son  
I ain't different from anyone  
It ain't no use a-talking to me  
It's just the same as talking to you.  
  
I was shadow-boxing earlier in the day  
I figured I was ready for Cassius Clay  
I said ""Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come  
26, 27, 28, 29, I'm gonna make your face look just like mine  
Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you'd better run  
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won't even recognize you  
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, gonna knock him clean right out of his spleen.""  
  
Well, I don't know, but I've been told  
The streets in heaven are lined with gold  
I ask you how things could get much worse  
If the Russians happen to get up there first.  
Wowee! Pretty scary!  
  
Now, I'm liberal, but to a degree  
I want ev'rybody to be free  
But if you think that I'll let Barry Goldwater  
Move in next door and marry my daughter  
You must think I'm crazy!  
I wouldn't let him do it for all the farms in Cuba.  
  
Well, I set my monkey on the log  
And ordered him to do the Dog  
He wagged his tail and shook his head  
And he went and did the Cat instead  
He's a weird monkey, very funky.  
  
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on  
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun  
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist  
And my wig-hat was falling in my face  
But they wouldn't let me on the tennis court.  
  
I gotta woman, she's so mean  
She sticks my boots in the washing machine  
Sticks me with buckshot when I'm nude  
Puts bubblegum in my food  
She's funny, wants my money, calls me ""honey.""  
  
Now I gotta friend who spends his life  
Stabbing my picture with a bowie-knife  
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf  
When my name comes up he pretends to barf.  
I've got a million friends!  
  
Now they asked me to read a poem  
At the sorority sister's home  
I got knocked down and my head was swimmin'  
I wound up with the Dean of Women  
Yippee! I'm a poet, and I know it.  
Hope I don't blow it.  
  
I'm gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange  
So I look like a walking mountain range  
And I'm gonna ride into Omaha on a horse  
Out to the country club and the golf course.  
Carry the New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds.  
  
Now you're probably wondering by now  
Just what this song is all about  
What's probably got you baffled more  
Is what this thing here is for.  
It's nothing  
It's something I learned over in England.

Bob Dylan,I Shall Be Released,"They say evrything can be replaced,  
Yet every distance is not near.  
So I remember every face  
Of every man who put me here.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west onto the east.  
Any day now, any day how,  
I shall be released.  
  
They say every man needs protection,  
They say every man must fall.  
Yet I swear I see my reflection  
Some place so high above this wall.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west onto the east.  
Any day now, any day how,  
I shall be released.  
  
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd,  
Is a man who swears he's not to blame.  
All day long I hear him shout so loud,  
Crying out that he was framed.  
I see my light come shining  
From the west onto the east.  
Any day now, any day how,  
I shall be released.

Bob Dylan,I Threw It All Away,"I once held her in my arms,  
She said she would always stay.  
But I was cruel,  
I treated her like a fool,  
I threw it all away.  
  
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand,  
And rivers that ran through ev'ry day.  
I must have been mad,  
I never knew what I had,  
Until I threw it all away.  
  
Love is all there is, it makes the world go 'round,  
Love and only love, it can't be denied.  
No matter what you think about it  
You just won't be able to do without it.  
Take a tip from one who's tried.  
  
So if you find someone that gives you all of her love,  
Take it to your heart, don't let it stray,  
For one thing that's certain,  
You will surely be a-hurtin',  
If you throw it all away.

Open up the gate for you.

True love they've been without it.  
But all their daughters put me down

Honey, I want you.

You're gonna cry for pills  
And your head's gonna be in a knot,  
But the pills are gonna cost more  
Than what you've got.  
Hey, hey!  
I'd sure hate to be you  
On that dreadful day.  
  
You're gonna have to walk naked,  
Can't ride in no car.  
You're gonna let ev'rybody see  
Just what you are.  
Hey, hey!  
I'd sure hate to be you  
On that dreadful day.  
  
Well, the good wine's a-flowin'  
For five cents a quart.  
You're gonna look in your moneybags  
And find you're one cent short.  
Hey, hey, hey!  
I'd sure hate to be you  
On that dreadful day.  
  
You're gonna yell and scream,  
""Don't anybody care?""  
You're gonna hear out a voice say,  
""Shoulda listened when you heard the word down there.""  
Hey, hey!  
I'd sure hate to be you  
On that dreadful day."
Bob Dylan,I'd Have You Anytime,"by Bob Dylan and George Harrison  
  
Let me in here, I know I've been here,  
Let me into your heart.  
Let me know you, let me show you,  
Let me roll it to you.  
All I have is yours,  
All you see is mine  
And I'm glad to have you in my arms,  
I'd have you any time.  
  
Let me say it, let me play it,  
Let me lay it on you.  
Let me know you, let me show you,  
Let me grow it on you.  
All I have is yours,  
All you see is mine  
And I'm glad to have you in my arms,  
I'd have you any time.  
  
Let me in here, I know I've been here,

Bob Dylan,Idiot Wind,"Someone's got it in for me, they're planting stories in the press  
Whoever it is I wish they'd cut it out but when they will I can only guess.  
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy,  
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me.  
I can't help it if I'm lucky.  
  
People see me all the time and they just can't remember how to act  
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts.  
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at,  
I couldn't believe after all these years, you didn't know me better than that  
Sweet lady.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth,  
Blowing down the back roads headin' south.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike  
I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.  
There's a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pourin' out of a boxcar door,  
You didn't know it, you didn't think it could be done, in the final end he won
the wars  
After losin' every battle.  
  
I woke up on the roadside, daydreamin' 'bout the way things sometimes are  
Visions of your chestnut mare shoot through my head and are makin' me see
stars.  
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies.  
One day you'll be in the ditch, flies buzzin' around your eyes,  
Blood on your saddle.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb,  
Blowing through the curtains in your room.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart  
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn't enough to change my heart.  
Now everything's a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have
stopped,  
What's good is bad, what's bad is good, you'll find out when you reach the top  
You're on the bottom.  
  
I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind  
I can't remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes  
Don't look into mine.  
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the
building  
Burned.  
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the
springtime  
Turned Slowly into autumn.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull,  
From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol.  
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth,  
You're an idiot, babe.  
It's a wonder that you still know how to breathe.  
  
I can't feel you anymore, I can't even touch the books you've read  
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishin' I was somebody else instead.  
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy,  
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory  
And all your ragin' glory.  
  
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I'm finally free,  
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from
me.  
You'll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above,  
And I'll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love,  
And it makes me feel so sorry.  
  
Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats,  
Blowing through the letters that we wrote.  
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves,  
We're idiots, babe.  
It's a wonder we can even feed ourselves.

Bob Dylan,If Dogs Run Free,"If dogs run free, then why not we  
Across the swooping plain?  
My ears hear a symphony  
Of two mules, trains and rain.  
The best is always yet to come,  
That's what they explain to me.  
Just do your thing, you'll be king,  
If dogs run free.  
  
If dogs run free, why not me  
Across the swamp of time?  
My mind weaves a symphony  
And tapestry of rhyme.  
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee  
So it may flow and be,  
To each his own, it's all unknown,  
If dogs run free.  
  
If dogs run free, then what must be,  
Must be, and that is all.  
True love can make a blade of grass  
Stand up straight and tall.  
In harmony with the cosmic sea,  
True love needs no company,  
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole,  
If dogs run free.

Bob Dylan,If Not For You,"If not for you,  
Babe, I couldn't find the door,  
Couldn't even see the floor,  
I'd be sad and blue,  
If not for you.  
  
If not for you,  
Babe, I'd lay awake all night,  
Wait for the mornin' light  
To shine in through,  
But it would not be new,  
If not for you.  
  
If not for you  
My sky would fall,  
Rain would gather too.  
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all,  
I'd be lost if not for you,

Anyway it wouldn't ring true,

Bob Dylan,If You See Her Say Hello,"If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier  
She left here last early spring, is livin' there, I hear  
Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow  
She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so.  
  
We had a falling-out, like lovers often will  
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill  
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart  
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart.  
  
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me  
I always have respected her for busting out and gettin' free  
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way  
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her
stay.  
  
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds  
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town  
And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off  
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft.  
  
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past  
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast  
If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find  
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time.

Some people are very kind.  
But if I can save you any time,

Bob Dylan,I'll Remember You,"I'll remember you  
When I've forgotten all the rest  
You to me were true  
You to me were the best  
When there is no more  
You cut to the core  
Quicker than anyone I knew  
When I'm all alone  
In the great unknown  
I'll remember you.  
  
I'll remember you  
At the end of the trail  
I had so much left to do  
I had so little time to fail  
There's some people that  
You don't forget  
Even though you've only seen 'em  
One time or two  
When the roses fade  
And I'm in the shade  
I'll remember you.  
  
Didn't I, didn't I try to love you?  
Didn't I, didn't I try to care?  
Didn't I sleep, didn't I weep beside you  
With the rain blowing in your hair.  
  
I'll remember you  
When the wind blows through the piny wood  
It was you who came right through  
It was you who understood  
Though I'd never say  
That I done it the way  
That you'd have liked me to  
In the end  
My dear sweet friend  
I'll remember you.

Bob Dylan,I'm Not There,"She came all rightoned and she's all too tight in my neighborhood  
She cried both day and night  
I know it because it was there.  
It's a milestone, but she's down on her luck  
And she daily salooning, but to me too hot to book  
I would then.  
  
I believe where she'd stop in if she wants time to care  
I believe that she'd look upon beside him to care  
And I go by the Lord and where she's on my way, but I don't belong there.  
No I don't belong to her, I don't belong to every choir  
She's my prize forsaken angel, but she don't hear me cry  
She's a long hearted mystic and she can't carry on  
When I'm there she's alright, but when she's not when I'm gone.  
Heaven knows that the answers she's don't calling no one  
She's the way for sailing beautiful  
She's mine for the one  
And I lost her attention by tempation as it runs  
But she don't bother me  
But I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Now I've cried tonight like I cried the night before  
And I'm leased on the high some  
But I dream about the door  
It's so long she's forsaken by a fate with the tale  
It don't hang approximation  
She smiled Fare Thee Well.  
  
Now when I'll treat the way we all was born to love her  
But she knows that the kingdom weighs so high above her  
And I run but I wait  
And it's not too fast or slam  
But I'll not perceive her  
I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Well it's all about division  
And I cry for a bail  
I don't need anybody now beside me to tell  
And it's all affirmation I received but it's not  
She's a long haunting beauty  
But she's gone like the spark  
And she's gone.  
  
Yes she's gone like the rainbow that shined in yesterday  
But now she's home beside me  
And I'd like to hear to stay  
She's a bone forsaking beauty and it don't trust anyone  
Now I wish I was beside her but I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Well it's too hard to stake in  
And I don't far believe  
It's a bag full it's amusing  
That she's hard too hard to lead.  
It's a load, it's a crime  
The way she mauled me around  
Was she told for to hate me, but just don't forethink in clown.  
  
Yes I believe that it's rightful  
Oh I believe it in my mind  
I been told like I said one night before  
Carry on the grind.  
And this song gypsy told her like I said carry on  
I wish I was there to help her  
But I'm not there I'm gone.

I know it because it was there.  
It's a milestone, but she's down on her luck  
And she daily salooning, but to me too hot to book  
I would then.  
  
I believe where she'd stop in if she wants time to care  
I believe that she'd look upon beside him to care  
And I go by the Lord and where she's on my way, but I don't belong there.  
No I don't belong to her, I don't belong to every choir  
She's my prize forsaken angel, but she don't hear me cry  
She's a long hearted mystic and she can't carry on  
When I'm there she's alright, but when she's not when I'm gone.  
Heaven knows that the answers she's don't calling no one  
She's the way for sailing beautiful  
She's mine for the one  
And I lost her attention by tempation as it runs  
But she don't bother me  
But I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Now I've cried tonight like I cried the night before  
And I'm leased on the high some  
But I dream about the door  
It's so long she's forsaken by a fate with the tale  
It don't hang approximation  
She smiled Fare Thee Well.  
  
Now when I'll treat the way we all was born to love her  
But she knows that the kingdom weighs so high above her  
And I run but I wait  
And it's not too fast or slam  
But I'll not perceive her  
I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Well it's all about division  
And I cry for a bail  
I don't need anybody now beside me to tell  
And it's all affirmation I received but it's not  
She's a long haunting beauty  
But she's gone like the spark  
And she's gone.  
  
Yes she's gone like the rainbow that shined in yesterday  
But now she's home beside me  
And I'd like to hear to stay  
She's a bone forsaking beauty and it don't trust anyone  
Now I wish I was beside her but I'm not there I'm gone.  
  
Well it's too hard to stake in  
And I don't far believe  
It's a bag full it's amusing  
That she's hard too hard to lead.  
It's a load, it's a crime  
The way she mauled me around  
Was she told for to hate me, but just don't forethink in clown.  
  
Yes I believe that it's rightful  
Oh I believe it in my mind  
I been told like I said one night before  
Carry on the grind.  
And this song gypsy told her like I said carry on  
I wish I was there to help her  
But I'm not there I'm gone."

Bob Dylan,Is Your Love In Vain ?,"Do you love me, or are you just extending goodwill?  
Do you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt?  
I've been burned before and I know the score  
So you won't hear me complain.  
Will I be able to count on you  
Or is your love in vain?  
  
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?  
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?  
Do you know my world, do you know my kind  
Or must I explain?  
Will you let me be myself  
Or is your love in vain?  
  
Well I've been to the mountain and I've been in the wind,  
I've been in and out of happiness.  
I have dined with kings, I've been offered wings  
And I've never been too impressed.  
  
All right, I'll take a chance, I will fall in love with you  
If I'm a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too.  
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow,  
Do you understand my pain?  
Are you willing to risk it all  
Or is your love in vain?

Bob Dylan,Isis,"I married Isis on the fifth day of May  
But I could not hold on to her very long  
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away  
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong.  
  
I came to a high place of darkness and light  
The dividing line ran through the center of town  
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right  
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down.  
  
A man in the corner approached me for a match  
I knew right away he was not ordinary  
He said ""Are you looking for something easy to catch ?""  
I said ""I got no money"". He said ""That ain't necessary"".  
  
We set out that night for the cold in the North  
I gave him my blanket he gave me his word  
I said ""Where are we going ?"" He said ""We'd be back by the fourth""  
I said ""That's the best new that I've ever heard"".  
  
I was thinking about turquoise I was thinking about gold  
I was thinking about diamonds and the world's biggest necklace  
As we rode through the canyons through the devilish cold  
I was thinking about Isis how she thought I was so reckless.  
  
How she told me that one day we meet up again  
And things would be different the next time we wed  
If I only could hang on and just be her friend  
I still can't remember all the best things she said.  
  
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice  
He said ""There's a body I'm trying to find  
If I carry it out it'll bring a good prize""  
It was then that I knew what he had on his mind.  
  
The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous  
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn  
When he died I was hoping that it wasn't contagious  
But I made up my mind that I had to go on.  
I broke into the tomb but the casket was empty  
There was no jewels no nothing I felt I'd been had  
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly  
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad.  
  
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside  
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover  
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied  
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her.  
  
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise  
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed  
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes  
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead.  
  
She said ""Where ya been ?"" I said ""No place special ?""  
She said ""You look different"" I said ""Well I guess""  
She said ""You been gone"" I said ""That's only natural""  
She said ""You gonna stay ?"" I said ""If you want me to, Yeah "".  
  
Isis oh Isis you mystical child  
What drives me to you is what drives me insane  
I still can remember the way that you smiled  
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain.

Donna Summer,Can't We Just Sit Down,"Cold and lonely night, you don't have to leave at all

Can't we just sit down and talk it over

Strange that you're the one so set on leaving

And maybe you and I can talk it out

He came to bring us everything that we need  
To set us free  
Now I long to feel that christmas spirit in my heart  
Yes I long to feel that christmas spirit in my heart  
So turn your heart throbs in  
And let God grow within  
Not to destroy  
The greatest gift I've known  
He came to earth to bring love  
To show us love  
He came to bring us peace  
He came to bring us joy  
He came to bring us everything  
Have faith if we believe  
The gift that we receive  
Is like that love and everything  
The greatest gift I've known  
He came to earth to bring love  
He came to bring us everything  
Still l long to feel that christmas spirit in my heart  
Yes I long to feel that christmas spirit in my heart  
Now I long to feel that christmas spirit in my heart"
Donna Summer,Cold Love,"I'm walking the line  
I'm walking the line  
Treading thin ice  
Time after time  
  
I go for the best, end up with much less  
I need the real thing  
Forget all the rest  
  
Started out good  
Working out bad  
All the sweet love turner  
Sour and sad  
  
A face and name  
It's always the same  
So tired of playing love's foolish games  
Tell me why  
Love passes me by  
  
[Chorus]  
Cold love, cold love  
Another shot of rock 'n' roll love  
Cold love, cold love  
Whatever happened to that  
Good old love  
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why  
Tell me why, tell me why  
  
Hope in the dark, love in the light  
I'll keep on looking for someone  
Who's right  
  
I'm out for the best  
Can you stand the test  
I need the real thing  
No more and no less  
Tell me why  
Love passes me by

and the waters flow around me  
  
Like the colour of sun I cannot explain  
behind the familiar the view is strange  
maybe to love is to fly apart  
and this emotion the cry of a waking heart

Golden slumber  
now and forever  
truly rising  
imagine heaven  
one vibration

Donna Summer,Eyes,"Right outside the window something's happening  
A man he stares into a TV screen  
From the next apartment we hear music  
Bleeding through the scene  
  
TV pans the bedroom, woman's sleeping  
Hands are sprawled out loosely across the bed  
She must be pretty rich  
'Cause I can see all the diamonds on her neck  
  
[Chorus]  
And there's always someone watching  
Eyes  
TV's and someone's watching  
Eyes  
In the kitchen someone's watching  
Eyes  
And the maid and butler's watching  
Eyes  
  
Silent sunbeams falling across the window  
Suddenly she awakens with surprise  
Day and night they always go so quickly  
In TV time...  
  
Her husband rushes in and in the meantime  
She just slightly smiles and turns her head  
He just whispers something to her softly  
God knows what he said...  
  
You know it wasn't very long  
Before the two of them were kissing  
She was his wife, he was her man  
But they knew what they were missing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
TV's on and someone's watching  
Eyes  
They're getting in through your eyes  
Don't let them poison your mind...

Donna Summer,From A Distance,"From a distance, the world looks blue and green,  
And the snow capped mountains white.  
From a distance, the ocean meets the stream,  
And the eagle takes to flight.  
From a distance, there is harmony,  
And the echo through the land.  
It's the voice of hope,  
It's the voice of peace,  
It's the voice of every man.  
From a distance, we all have enough,  
And no one is in need.  
And there are no guns, no bombs and no diseases,  
No hungry mouths to feed.  
From a distance, we are instruments,  
Matching in a common band,  
Playing songs of hope,  
Playing songs of peace,  
There is the song of every man.  
God is watching us, God is watching us,  
God is watching us, from a distance,  
Ohh God is watching us....... From a distance.  
From a distance, you look like my friend, even though we're at war.  
From a distance, I just cannot comprehend, what all this fighting is for?  
It's the hope of?, it's the love of all, it's the heart of every man.  
It's the hope of?, it's the love of all, it is the song of every man.  
Oh.. God is watching us, God is watching us..... From a distance

Donna Summer,Full Of Emptiness,"Full of emptiness  
Broken promises  
And love turned out so sad  
The hurt goes on and on  
  
Full of emptiness  
Hello loneliness  
Good friends will mind  
The sands of time  
Have slipped through my hands  
  
From the bottom to the top  
Why he had me feeling fine  
Then i took a long long drop  
When he walked out of my life  
My world  
  
Full of emptiness  
That and something less  
And memories of him  
Have never seemed to be

Donna Summer,Heaven's Just A Whisper Away,"Watching raindrops, slowly falling  
Painting pictures on the window pane

Seems like I can hear a melody  
Baby that's what you do to me  
  
(chorus):  
One thing I'm sure of  
Whether it's wrong or it's right  
I only want to be with you, tonight  
And if you want me to  
Baby ask me to stay  
Heaven's just a whisper away  
  
Feel the magic, taking over  
Please don't stop before we lose control  
Baby just let your feeling go  
Soft and tender, like the morning  
We get closer than we've ever been  
We're almost to the rainbow's end  
  
(chorus):  
I heard the winds of forever  
Calling out my name  
It's paradise, when I'm with you  
I will never be the same  
  
Please don't wake me if I'm dreaming  
'cause this time, this one is coming true  
So glad to share my dreams with you

Seclusion in our love so deep  
A world to touch that meant so much to me

The cool romance and nights of ecstasy  
Slip slowly by on paper wings

And days we loved together in the past

And I said ""I want you too""  
Am I just a fool?  
  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to get hurt  
I'm not looking for just another heartache  
I don't want to get hurt  
But I know it's a chance I've got to take  
  
Just another heartache  
I don't need all my friends to tell me  
Things that I already know  
Like in the best of all worlds  
You shouldn't forget self-control  
  
Don't say I don't know what I'm doing  
And he said ""it's more than a feeling""  
And I said ""I need you too""  
Am I just a fool?  
  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to get hurt  
I'm not looking for just another heartache  
I don't want to get hurt  
But I know it's a chance I've got to take  
  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to get hurt  
I'm not looking for just another heartache  
I don't want to get hurt  
But I know it's a chance I've got to take  
  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to get hurt  
I'm not looking for just another heartache  
I don't want to get hurt"
Donna Summer,I Love You,"From my once upon a time album  
A song about two people who fell in love  
Showing up one day face to face  
  
Well he searched and searched for nights and days  
Till he found the one he loved  
And he wrapped her in his arms again  
And then he thanked the stars above  
That he found what he'd been looking for  
And he stared her in the eyes  
  
He said ""I love you""  
Yes, I really do  
  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
  
She stared him right back in the eyes  
With a look of disbelief  
Then she gazed off into somewhere else  
Was it real or just a dream?  
And she pulled him oh so close to her  
And she whispered in his ear  
  
She said ""I love you""  
Yes, I really do  
  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
  
So together they will always be  
Until the stars fall from the sky  
  
They said ""I love you""  
Yes, they really do  
They said ""I love you""  
Yes, they do  
  
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do  
  
So together they will always be  
Until the stars fall from the sky  
So if you find someone you love a lot  
You must never let them go  
You just hold them tight with all your might  
And you say three little words  
  
You say ""I love you""  
Yes, I really do  
You say ""I love you""  
Yes I do  
You say ""I love you""

Donna Summer,I'm Free,"I was stranded in the dark  
Trying to find an open door, so alone  
Chains were wrapped around my heart  
Didn't know what love was for, no more

No you can't get away  
When the spirit in me said  
Your love could show me the way  
My whole life changed on that day  
Now I'm walking in the light all aglow  
All I see is sunshine in my eyes  
Skies of blue, it's true, I'm free

Out from under shadows  
The only thing that matters  
Is that you've worked a miracle in me  
I'm free  
Now when clouds surround me  
They have no place around me  
All because your love has set me free  
I'm free  
  
From the time that I knew  
That I could find love in you  
My heart's been renewed  
Now all my dreams are coming true  
I was frightened in the cold  
Desperate when you found me in time  
You saved me from the world  
Got my life back in control  
Chased away the madness in my mind  
You saved me right in time  
Now the future's looking up  
Skies are blue, all because of you  
Got the sunshine in my life  
All aglow, baby, don't you know, I'm free

Donna Summer,La Vie En Rose,"I thought that love was just a word  
Sung about in songs I heard  
Kisses could reveal that I was wrong  
And love was real  
Hold me close and hold me fast  
The magic spell you cast  
This is la vie en rose  
When you kiss me heaven sighs  
And though I close my eyes  
I see la vie en rose  
When you press me to your heart  
I'm in a world apart  
A world where roses bloom  
And when you speak, angels sing from above  
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs  
Give your heart and soul to me  
And life will always be

As our leaders roll the dice  
The human spirit cries  
Its a precious, precious, precious...sacrifice.

Don't you know history's keeping score  
And just once more  
For every boy and every girl let there be love  
All over the world  
For everyone  
Under the sun  
(Chorus):  
Let there be peace on earth  
Let every voice be heard  
Le there be peace on earth  
Brother to brother  
'til it's felt around the world  
There's only one world in which we all mus live  
Heaven shoe us how to forgive  
And on that marble wall which holds a million names  
Generations of dreams gone down in flames  
Isn't, isn't it a shame  
For every boy and every girl  
Under the sun...  
(Chorus):  
Let there be peace on earth  
(why don't you try just a little harder)  
Let every voice be heard  
(my brother)  
Let there be peace on earth  
(oh, if we could just get it together)  
'til it's felt around the world...  
We're running out of time  
As our leaders roll the dice  
The human spirit cries  
Its a precious, precious, precious...sacrifice.  
(Chorus x2)  
Save the babies, save the babies  
If we only get it together  
If we could only get it together  
I think we could make it  
Think we could make it  
Save the children...  
Save the children..."

Donna Summer,Love Has A Mind Of Its Own,"Think about me and you  
Think of all the changes we've been through  
The laughter an' the tears  
The years together  
Little did we both know  
When we fell we gave up all control  
Though times get hard  
We're strong enough to carry on  
'Cause love has a mind of its own  
It moves in it's own circles  
And it roams where it will roam

That passion wasn't pain  
My heart had changed  
But then in the morning light  
The feeling cut me like a knife

Till the world gets in between

Say you know the way  
To find true freedom  
Can you save yourself  
From the pain you're feeling  
Something in my head  
That you're dreaming

Love is the healer  
Love is the healer

Do you know what love  
Can do  
Do you know what  
It'll do for you  

","So many times in my life  
I've been alone, left alone  
Heart broken and  
Turned around  
I find myself  
Crying in the night time  
Dying out loud  
In the night I sleeplessly  
Wake up  
From a dream that's  
Tormenting me  
I, I, I, I, I gotta get help  
Oh, yeah  
Love is the healer  
Love is the healer  
Come heal me  
Love is the healer  
Love is the healer  
Set me free  
Late at night I was afraid  
And I tried to turn away  
I was afraid to face  
What in-evil-it-able is  
Say you know the way  
To find true freedom  
Can you save yourself  
From the pain you're feeling

But we're alone and I'm singing my song for all of you  
I know your image of me is what I hope to be  
I treated you unkindly but boy can't you see  
There's noone more important to me  
Baby can't you please see through me  
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing my song for all of you  
I love you in a place we're there's no space or time  
I love you for my life cause you're friends of mine  
And when my life is over  
Remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singing my song for all of you  
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing  
You came out in front I was hiding  
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together  
Listen to the melody  
Cause my love's in there hiding  
I love you in a place where there's no space or time

Donna Summer,Sand On My Feet,"Wakin' up this morning

And I looked up on the porch  
And found an owl shrieking by  
But never could I have imagined  
Such a place like this  
And you're lyin' next to me  
I wanna wake you with a kiss  
  
And all the crazy things about you  
That I so adore  
Are the little things that keep me  
Coming back for more  
  
[Chorus]  
And it feels like love, and it feels so good  
I wanna feel like the roarin' thunder  
Wanna be the heaven that your sky is under  
Oh, I say, you say, oh (It's like love)  
All that I need, baby it's true  
The sand on my feet and you  
  
I will go wherever you go  
Take me where you lead  
Lead me where you want  
My heart doesn't know  
Anything but what you say  
You're the one for me  
You make me feel complete  
  
I can silent read your whisper  
And my lips still feel your touch  
And I'm oh so glad to be here  
Oh so glad to be here

Wanna be the heaven that your sky is under

Miles along the shore  
And a thousand seagulls called on me  
So we came right back for more  
And I love to feel the water  
It makes me feel so free  
Underneath the purple sky  
Every time you look at me  
  
I reach up to forever  
With the promises you keep  
They fill me with such happiness  
It makes my heart believe  
  
[Chorus]  
And it feels like love, and it feels so good  
I wanna feel like the roarin' thunder  
Wanna be the heaven that your sky is under  
Oh, I say, you say, oh (It's like love)  
All that I need, baby it's true  
The sand on my feet and you  
  
How many lovers  
Have walked along the shore before  
Before you and I  
How many said goodbye

","Wakin' up this morning  
Saw the sun come through my blinds  
And I looked up on the porch  
And found an owl shrieking by  
But never could I have imagined  
Such a place like this  
And you're lyin' next to me  
I wanna wake you with a kiss  
  
And all the crazy things about you  
That I so adore  
Are the little things that keep me  
Coming back for more  
  
  
And it feels like love, and it feels so good  
I wanna feel like the roarin' thunder  
Wanna be the heaven that your sky is under  
Oh, I say, you say, oh (It's like love)  
All that I need, baby it's true  
The sand on my feet and you  
  
I will go wherever you go  
Take me where you lead  
Lead me where you want  
My heart doesn't know  
Anything but what you say  
You're the one for me  
You make me feel complete  
  
I can silent read your whisper  
And my lips still feel your touch  
And I'm oh so glad to be here  
Oh so glad to be here  
  
  
And it feels like love, and it feels so good  
I wanna feel like the roarin' thunder  
Wanna be the heaven that your sky is under  
Oh, I say, you say, oh (It's like love)  
All that I need, baby it's true

Donna Summer,Say A Little Prayer,"Mr. Moonlight...shine bright  
Show me my Mr. Right  
Lights, camera, action

You must let him know  
This is love from the start

Say a little prayer for me tonight  
Say a little prayer

Broke my back, been split open so oft

Gotta throw down, you gotta stand and fight

Woah, yeah  
  
I've been round so many times before  
Broke my back, been split open so oft  
Tried to make it to the finish line  
Been knocked down, get up every single time  
They're up in your face, they don't think you belong  
Man, you got it, you got it goin' on  
What breaks the weak just makes you strong  
You got game, baby bring it on, bring it on  
  
  
(And) I said Stamp your feet on the ground  
Make it really loud, make the biggest sound  
You ain't goin',  
Stamp your feet on the ground  
Make it really loud

Stamp your feet on the ground  
Make it really loud, make the biggest sound  
You ain't goin',  
Stamp your feet on the ground  
Make it really loud  
You ain't goin', you ain't goin' down  
  
Rain comes in every player's life  
Gotta stay in the game, not on the sidelines  
Gotta throw down, you gotta stand and fight  
Keep your eye on the prize, don't get caught up in strife  
Go, go for the shot boy, make that play just right  
Braggin' about your swag won't get you through the night  
  
  
  
S-T-A-M-P You got game  
S-T-A-M-P You got fame  
S-T-A-M-P You got name

Donna Summer,Starting Over Again,"Mama moved out  
Daddy sold the house  
They split up the money  
And went on their way  
And all the king's horses  
And all the king's men

Starting Over Again  
Where should they begin  
'Cause they've never been out on their own  
Starting over again  
Never any end  
When your dreams are all shattered  
And the kids almost grown  
And the whole world cries  
He got an apartment  
She moved in with her sisters  
And he's scheming big deals with one of his friends  
While she sits at home  
Sortin' out pieces  
Of left over memories from thirty odd years  
Starting Over again  
Where do you begin  
When you've never been out on your own  
Starting Over Again  
Never any end  
What will the neighbours say  
(Just) talkin' talk it's small town news  
What will all the neighbours hear  
They just know they disappeared  
(They're) facing fifty years old wrecking up a happy home  
And this far down the road  
You find yourself alone  
Two fools  
Starting Over Again

So help me find him  
  
Father, hear me calling

And he could fill my emptiness too

I may never see the man again, so help me find him  
Help me, help me

I'm alone, and I can't sleep from crying  
Father dear, well if you hear me  
I've been held closely by a stranger

In a glance  
I knew right from the start that I adored him

Won't you tell him just how much I love him

Please, won't you make him love me too

Donna Summer,Take Heart,"Take heart.... Even though you find it hard  
To catch your breath, much less smile  
  
Take heart... Even when your sky is dark  
There'll come a day the clouds will go  
Then you'll know once again what life can be  
When you feel all the joy it can bring...  
  
Chorus:  
If only we could understand what God only knows  
Maybe then it would be easy letting go  
But if the spirit lives forever and true love never dies  
There'll always be a light in your soul  
  
Take heart... In each and every tear your cry  
The strength you need will be yours in time  
  
Take heart... Someday's not that far away  
There is that place where hope will abide  
And you'll find that your heart feels deeper now  
Through the love that's been lost through goodbye  
  
If only we could understand what God only knows  
Maybe then it would be easy letting go  
But if the spirit lives forever and true love never dies  
There'll always be a light in your soul  
  
Always remember to treasure the time  
So man questions with no reason why  
Life passes by... So it goes  
  
If only we could understand what God only knows  
Maybe then it would be easy letting go  
But if the spirit lives forever and true love never dies  
There'll always be a light in your soul

Donna Summer,The Christmas Song,"Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack frost nipping at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dresses up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said  
Many times many ways  
""Merry Christmas""

Donna Summer,The Planet Is Alive,"There is life in shadowed caverns  
Where the gray-blue gardens grow  
In the forests and the deserts  
In the wind and in the snows  
And it's all the precious cargo  
Of our fragile spaceship earth  
And it's countless voices cry on  
Let us live  
Let us live  
The miracle is that they're here at all in the timeless night  
We are all fabric of life  
This miracle may never come again  
The planet is alive let it live  
Let us live  
In the roaring soaring cities  
In the mills and in the minds  
In the ice fields and the rice fields  
People work and live their lives  
And they strive to raise their children  
Hoping somehow they'll survive  
Is it all to much to ask for  
Let them live  
Let them live  
It's a thousand million light years  
To the farthest fringe of space  
And there may be nothing out there  
Even like the human race  
And we may be all alone then on our tiny island home  
And the planet is alive oh let it live  
Let it live

Donna Summer,The Wanderer,"Woke up this morning  
Dragged myself across the bed  
Alice went to wonderland  
But I stayed home instead  
I started feeling bad  
'Cause I was left behind  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Oh yes, I'm a wanderer  
  
She climbed right through the mirror  
Oh that really blew my mind  
I think I'll follow through her rhythm  
And her rhyme  
I know I'm ready now  
It's just a little time  
'Cause I'm a wanderer

That nine to five life  
It's a bore

Donna Summer,(Theme) Once Upon A Time (alternative),"[Voice monologue over ""Once Upon A Time"" instrumental]  
  
Once upon a time, there was a girl  
She lived in the land of never-never  
Where everything real is unreal  
And only fairy tales come true  
Something like me and you  
  
But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real  
So she strived on to make it come true  
Fighting odds, not knowing what would come of her  
Never giving up the hope within her  
  
She carried on and on, because she believed  
That once, once in a time in her lifetime  
The things so unreal would be real  
  
And in the morning, one day when she awoke  
To find herself surrounded by the same old room  
She was disappointed  
  
So she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she said that fairy tales do come true  
'Cause I believe, I believe  
  
And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting  
Till one day she met a man who held her tight  
And she fell in love  
  
Once upon a time, in the land of never-never  
Where all things real are unreal  
There lived a girl who believed  
That all things could be possible  
  
And one day she did awake  
And found herself somewhere else  
Beside her a brand new face  
Of someone that she loved

The things so unreal would be real  
  
And in the morning, one day when she awoke  
To find herself surrounded by the same old room  
She was disappointed  
  
So she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she said that fairy tales do come true  
'Cause I believe, I believe  
  
And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting  
Till one day she met a man who held her tight  
And she fell in love  
  
Once upon a time, in the land of never-never  
Where all things real are unreal  
There lived a girl who believed  
That all things could be possible  
  
And one day she did awake  
And found herself somewhere else  
Beside her a brand new face  
Of someone that she loved"
Donna Summer,Theme To Dream A Lot ( I Will Live For Love),"Theme to Dream a Lot (I will live for love) By, Donna Summers  
  
There's got to be a way that I can dream  
Simply close my eyes and see  
The worlds I've never known  
What places that my soul has been  
  
Sometimes I need to run away and hide  
I sail along so high  
Till nothing's in my sky  
Except the stars that fill my eyes  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm searching for the one who holds the key  
To all this crazy life I lead  
Through galaxies in time  
A solitary star that joins  
  
Sometimes I need to close my eyes and breathe  
Inhale what life has given me  
A bastion to ignite  
A flaming heart in flight  
I close my eyes  
I breathe  
I'm free  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I've always must have known  
A lover of his own  
'Cause that is when he wrote  
Everything I felt for love  
  
And I will fight for love in life and in love  
And I will hold the things above  
I'm strong enough to slay the dragon that's there  
I will live for love  
  
I've thought about this life  
This dream will never die  
So only know that I  
I will live for love  
  
Always must have known a lover of his own  
That is when he wrote everything I felt for love  
I will ever fight  
I will live for life  
I will live for love

Donna Summer,There Goes My Baby,"All alone I sit looking out of the window  
And the rain just keeps coming on down  
Well I cry to myself  
So many things that I've done wrong  
Now I'm watching you walk out  
  
There goes my baby  
Moving on down the line  
Wonder where, wonder where  
Wonder where he is bound  
  
I broke his heart  
And made him cry  
Now I'm alone, so all alone  
What can I do, what can I do  
  
Where is he going  
How is he what is he gonna do  
Where is he going  
And what on earth will he be going through oh

Donna Summer,To Turn The Stone,"The moon retreats behind a silver cloud  
As darkness throws its cloak towards the earth  
And mystery replaces what thought we knew  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
The one dimension only shows one side  
But do we see the same through different eyes  
As you and I peer into life's kaleidoscope  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
Eternal sands of time shift endlessly  
Behind a veil of motionless disguise  
An eyelid flash is all it really seems to need  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone

Donna Summer,True Love Survives,"On big alley stands a lady waiting  
For awhile  
Acting out an untold story like a  
Wounded child  
But the mystery of the circumstance  
Won't hide  
She believes true love survives  
True love survives  
  
Waiting for her long lost lover  
Returning from the war  
Though I know she knew the truth  
She also knew much more  
And the answer that she gave to all of us  
Whispered low saying  
True love survives  
True love survives  
  
Is she dreaming does she know  
A secret I can't see  
Maybe there's a trace of truth  
In all that she believes  
  
For one day I took a look deep down inside  
A voice cried saying true love's alive  
True love survives  
  
Only love will last forever true love will survive  
Only love will last forever true love will survive  
  
True is love is never-ending  
It's giving all and not pretending  
It's holding on although your heart  
Feels dead  
  
A quarter of a century of years  
Have gone by  
Still the dream of this peculiar  
Lady's kept alive  
So I'm holding tight to one who I desired  
A burning fire saying true love survives  
True love survives  
  
Only love will last forever  
Only love will last forever

Donna Summer,Virgin Mary (german Edition Track),"Look at the lady with the crazy stare in her eyes  
Looks way past 50 though she's barely 35  
Sleeps most days in the city park  
Every night down at Casey's bar  
And if she talks at all you hear her say  
""I was a lovely girl in my younger days""  
She was the prettiest girl this town had ever seen  
But she dressed too gaudy for the likes of the people here  
Out every night living life to the full  
A string of men at her beck and call  
But smalltown people got smalltown ways  
And soon she was stuck with a brandnew name  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Lover of lovers  
How many others  
Your bed is never empty  
It must bring you plenty  
Oh that fateful night there was thunder in the air  
The women were angry and the men felt like a share  
A lynch mob frenzy came over the town  
Grabbed hold of Mary, threw her down to the ground  
The first man there that had Mary laid  
Staggered back with shock on his face  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Be true to your name  
We've put you to shame  
You're not what we thought  
The victim of talk!  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Rumour was your ruin  
Evil talk was your undoing  
Heavy on the conscience  
Jealous talk and nonsense  
You were really like your name  
And we put you to shame  
You're not really what we thought

In money or love, or all the above,  
Have a little more than what you show.  
When life deals out a surprise  
Have a few surprises of your own.  
No matter what you do, no matter where you go  
You've got to have an ace in the hole.  
  
You've got to have an ace in the hole.  
A little secret that nobody knows.  
Life is a gamble, a game we all play,  
But you need to save something for a rainy day.  
You've got to learn to play your cards right if you expect to win in life.  
Don't put it all on the line for just one roll.  
You've got to have an ace in the hole.  
  
Don't put it all on the line for just one roll  
You've got to have an ace in the hole.

George Strait,Adalida,"[Chorus]  
Adalida, pretty little Cajun queen  
Sweet Dixie flower, the bell of the bayou

Adalida, I'd walk through the hurricane  
To stand beside ya sweet Adalida I'd swim the Ponchartrain  
  
Oh no, here ya coming down the road  
With your cotton dress a swishing  
You're getting some attention  
From all the boys in Thibodaux  
Oh my, you're really filling up their eyes  
Smiling and a winking  
I know what they're thinking  
But I'm the only one who loves you so

Oh no, the hottest little dish I know  
I know that you can tell it  
You're making me so jealous  
From my head down to my toes  
Oh me, you could make a red neck green  
The way that you're a looking  
You got me a cooking

And all alone as far as I could tell  
  
Why she left I have no way of knowing  
I guess she caught her train and that's a crime

By the light of a burnin' bridge

","Oh, I've been stumblin' through the darkness  
Tryin' to feel the ground beneath my feet  
Afraid of movin' much in any direction  
Stuck where the past and the future meet  
  
But I fin'lly got my first good look  
A little fire was all it too  
An' as the flames grew brighter  
I saw everything that I'd missed  
Once you get your courage up  
You light a match an' your eyes adjust  
It's amazing what a man can see  
By the light of a burnin' bridge  
  
An' there were things I saw that I'm not proud of  
Things that I'd do diff'rent now from then  
But when I really make myself get honest  
It's over and I can't go back again  
  
'Cause I fin'lly got my first good look  
A little fire was all it took  
An' as the flames grew brighter  
I saw everything that I'd missed  
Once you get your courage up  
You light a match an' your eyes adjust  
It's amazing what a man can see  
By the light of a burnin' bridge  
  
It sure is hard to let go and to leave the past behind  
But there ain't no other way that you can find some peace of mind  
  
When I fin'lly got my first good look  
A little fire was all it took  
An' as the flames grew brighter  
I saw everything that I'd missed  
Once you get your courage up  
You light a match an' your eyes adjust  
It's amazing what a man can see  
By the light of a burnin' bridge  
It's amazing what a man can see  
By the light of a burnin' bridge"
George Strait,Carrying Your Love With Me,"Baby all I've got is this beat-up leather bag  
And everything I own don't fill up half  
But don't you worry 'bout the way I pack  
All I care about is getting back real soon  
A good-bye kiss is all I need from you  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I'm carrying your love with me  
West Virginia down to Tennessee  
I'll be moving with the good Lord's speed  
Carrying your love with me  
It's my strength, for holding on  
Every minute that I have to be gone  
I'll have everything I'll ever need  
Carrying your love with me  
  
On a lonely highway, stuck out in the rain  
Darling all I have to do is speak your name  
The clouds rollback and the waters part  
The sun starts shining in my heart for you  
You're right there in everything I do  
  
[Chorus: x2]

George Strait,Check Yes Or No,"It started way back in third grade  
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes  
A pink dress, a matching bow, and her ponytail  
She kissed me on the school bus but told me not to tell  
Next day I chased her around the playground  
Cross the monkey bars to the merry-go-round  
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note  
Before the teacher took it I read what she wrote  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you love me do you want to be my friend  
And if you do  
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand  
If you want to  
I think this is how love goes  
Check yes or no  
  
Now we're grown up and she's my wife  
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes  
Not much has changed I still chase Emmylou  
Up and down the hall around the bed in our room  
Last night I took her out in a white limousine  
Twenty years together she still gets to me  
Can't believe it's been that long ago  
When we got started with just a little note

George Strait,Down And Out,"Well I'm out on a tear 'cause she's tearing me apart

You've a heart that's broken as a heart can be  
It's probably not like you at all  
To mix loneliness and alcohol  
He must have really hurt you bad  
Now it's 1 a.m. and here you are  
With some stranger at the bar  
He must have really hurt you bad  
  
Across town in some motel room  
He'll try to heal your past  
While the one that's lying next o you is only there for laughs  
He must have really hurt you bad  
  
Now I'm the Joe that sets you up then cuts you off  
And calls a cab when you need me to  
And I'd like to say that only once in a while  
I see someone goin' what you're goin' through  
  
Well, I need the tips, but I'll be alright  
If I don't see you tomorrow night  
Stay home girl  
He must have really hurt you bad  
  
He must have really hurt you bad"
George Strait,Heartbroke,"Now who wouldn't notice the fire in your eyes  
Or the bitter direction of impending good-byes  
I've followed and folded, i'm wilted in place  
At the sight of you standing with streaks down your face  
  
With your heart broke and running from the reason  
You got your heart broke, don't give up on believing in me  
Heart broke, who kept me from leaving?  
With my heart broke  
  
Now pride is a drag and a bore when you're lonely  
Sheer madness prevails upon reason to you  
But all is not lost, it's only mistaken  
That's small consolation but i know just how you feel  
  
With your heart broke and running from the reason  
You got your heart broke, don't give up on believing in me  
Heart broke , who kept me from leaving?  
With my heart broke  
  
Nobody said it was going to be easy  
We all have feelings that need a softer touch  
But nobody said that it would not be worth it  
The human condition continues as such  
  
With your heart broke and running from the reason  
You've got your heart broke, don't give up on believing in me  
Heart broke, who kept me from leaving?  
With my heart broke, youove got me heart broke

George Strait,Heaven Is Missing An Angel,"You came into my life like an answer to a prayer

George Strait,House Across The Bay,"Walkin' down this lonely stretch of beach  
She and I, walked down a thousand times  
I just can't force myself to give her up  
Like all the things she left behind  
Gone are the days when I'd wake up  
With her warm body next to mine  
  
It gets cold here in the wintertime  
And my mind drifts away  
To that house across the bay.  
A long talk and a glass of wine  
And we'd love the night away,  
But that was yesterday  
In that house across the bay.  
  
Her laughter was contagious  
Her walk, her talk, her smile lit up every room.  
They say things happen for a reason,  
But I can't find one good reason  
Why she's gone so soon.  
Life just seems to hang  
On every thought and everything  
We used to be.  
  
It gets cold here in the wintertime  
And my mind drifts away  
To that house across the bay.  
A long talk and a glass of wine  
And we'd love the night away,  
But that was yesterday  
In that house across the bay.  
  
There was sunshine everyday  
And we'd love the night away  
In that house across the bay.

","Walkin' down this lonely stretch of beach  
She and I, walked down a thousand times  
I just can't force myself to give her up  
Like all the things she left behind  
Gone are the days when I'd wake up  
With her warm body next to mine  
  
It gets cold here in the wintertime  
And my mind drifts away  
To that house across the bay.  
A long talk and a glass of wine  
And we'd love the night away,  
But that was yesterday  
In that house across the bay.  
  
Her laughter was contagious  
Her walk, her talk, her smile lit up every room.  
They say things happen for a reason,  
But I can't find one good reason  
Why she's gone so soon.  
Life just seems to hang  
On every thought and everything  
We used to be.  
  
It gets cold here in the wintertime  
And my mind drifts away  
To that house across the bay.  
A long talk and a glass of wine  
And we'd love the night away,  
But that was yesterday  
In that house across the bay.  
  
There was sunshine everyday  
And we'd love the night away  
In that house across the bay."
George Strait,How Bout Them Cowgirls,"I felt the rush of the Rio Grande into Yellowstone  
I've seen first-hand Niagara Falls  
And the lights of Vegas  
I've Criss-crossed down to Key Biscayne  
And Chi-town via Bangor, Maine  
Think I've seen it all  
And all I can say is  
  
[Chorus]  
How 'bout them cowgirls  
Boys ain't they something  
Sure are some proud girls  
And you can't tell them nothing  
And I tell you right now girls  
May just be seven wonders of this big, whole round world  
But how 'bout them cowgirls  
  
She's riding colts in Steamboat Springs  
Bailing hay outside Abilene  
She's trying hard  
To fit in some city  
But her home is 'neath that big, blue sky  
And the Northern Plains and those other wide open spaces  
Now a-days there ain't as many but  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Boy, she don't need you and she don't need me  
She can do just fine on her own two feet  
But she wants a man who wants her to be herself  
And she'll never change, don't know how to hide  
Her stubborn will or her fighting side  
But you treat her right and she'll love you like no one else  
  
Yeah, how 'bout them cowgirls  
Boys ain't they something  
Sure are some proud girls  
But you can't beat their loving  
  
And I'll tell you right now girls  
May just be seven wonders of this big, old round world

George Strait,I Aint' Her Cowboy Anymore,"I pack up my saddle  
Throw it in that two-horse trailer  
Back up my truck, hook 'em up  
And drive away  
Won't be the first time  
But this time's the last time  
She meant it when she said  
That's all I've got to say  
Never had been thrown like this before  
I ain't her cowboy anymore  
  
Never saw it comin'  
But I knew where it was goin'  
When she asked how long this time  
Before I hit the road  
She didn't come right out and say it  
But I sure got the message  
When I reached out to hold her  
That shoulder sure was cold  
Figured I'd just let goodbye run its course  
I ain't her cowboy anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
These white lines are a blur  
Like the last few nights I spent with her  
I don't know where I went wrong  
Or if I did  
Like the good ol' boy I am  
I told her that I understand  
But Lord knows that I won't long as I live  
Seems lately every time it rains it pours  
I ain't her cowboy anymore  
  
We met in Denver  
Settled down in Dallas  
The best days of my life  
Were the ones I spent with her  
You'd think that all that lovin' ought to count for something  
Guess I wore out my welcome  
Like the rowels of these old spurs  
That Casper sunset's what I'm shootin' for

George Strait,I Can Still Make Cheyenne,"Her telephone rang 'bout a quarter to nine  
She heard his voice on the other end of the line  
She wondered what was wrong this time  
She never knew what his calls might bring  
With a cowboy like him, it could be anything  
And she always expected the worst  
In the back of her mind  
  
He said, it's cold out here and I'm all alone  
I didn't make the short go again and I'm coming home  
I know I've been away too long  
I never got a chance to write or call  
And I know this rodeo has been hard on us all  
But I'll be home soon  
And honey is there somethin' wrong  
  
She said, don't bother comin' home  
By time you get here I'll be long gone  
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man  
He said, I'm sorry it's come down to this  
There's so much about you that I'm gonna miss  
But it's alright baby  
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne  
Gotta go now baby  
If I hurry I can still make Cheyenne  
  
He left that phone danglin' off the hook  
Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look  
Then he just walked away  
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line  
With a little luck he could still get there in time  
And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say

George Strait,I Hate Everything,"He was sitting there beside me throwing doubles down  
When he ordered up his third one he looked around  
Then he looked at me  
And said, ""I do believe  
I'll have one more.""  
He said, ""I hate this bar and I hate to drink,  
But on second thought, tonight I think, I hate everything.""  
  
Then he opened up his billfold and threw a twenty down,  
And a faded photograph fell out and hit the ground.  
I picked it up,  
He said, ""thank you, bud.""  
I put it in his hand.  
He said, ""I probably oughta throw this one away  
'cause she's the reason I feel this way.  
I hate everything.""  
  
I hate my job  
And I hate my life  
And if it weren't for my two kids  
I'd hate my ex wife.  
I know I should move on and try to start again,  
But I just can't get over her leaving me for him.  
Then he shook his head, looked down at his ring, said, ""I hate everything.""  
  
Said, ""that one bedroom apartment where I get my mail,  
Is really not a home, it's more like a jail,  
With a swimming pool, and a parking lot view.  
Man, it's just great.  
I hate summer, winter, fall and spring.

I hate everything.""  
  
I hate my job  
And I hate my life  
And if it weren't for my two kids  
I'd hate my ex wife.  
I know I should move on and try to start again,  
But I just can't get over her leaving me for him.  
Then he shook his head, looked down at his ring, said, ""I hate everything.""  
  
Said, ""that one bedroom apartment where I get my mail,  
Is really not a home, it's more like a jail,  
With a swimming pool, and a parking lot view.  
Man, it's just great.  
I hate summer, winter, fall and spring.  
Red and yellow, purple, blue and green.  
I hate everything.""  
  
I hate my job  
And I hate my life

Then he shook his head, looked down at his ring, said, ""I hate everything.""  
  
So I pulled out my phone and I called my house.  
I said, ""Babe, I'm coming home, we're gonna work this out.""  
I payed for his drinks  
And I told him thanks  
Thanks for everything."
George Strait,I Know What I Want For Christmas,"?Tis the season for generosity  
A time to give and to receive  
My Christmas list consists of just one sweet dream  
  
I know what I want for Christmas this year  
I hope my note got to Santa on time  
I'm a little bit nervous  
It's kind of a big thing I'm asking for  
I don't know if I deserve it but boy if I get it  
I'll never ask for anything more  
It shines, it's new  
And it's the one wish that I wish would come true  
This year for Christmas I just wanna be with you  
  
We can build a little fire  
We can sit and talk for hours  
We'll just have fun  
You can tell me what you did  
Christmas morning as a kid  
And we'll talk about all our Christmases to come  
  
And if I hang a little mistletoe in every single doorway  
I'm sure to get a kiss  
And is it too much to ask for a snowman kind of snow  
To complete this singular wish  
It shines, it's new  
I know what I want and nothin' else will do  
This year for Christmas, I just want to be with you

George Strait,I Saw God Today,"I just walked down the street to the coffee shop  
Had to take a break  
I'd been by her side for eighteen hours straight  
I saw a flower growing in the middle of the sidewalk  
Pushing up through the concrete  
Like it was planted right there for me to see  
The flashin' lights, the honkin' horns  
All seemed to fade away  
In the shadow of that hospital at 5:08  
I saw God today  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been to church  
I've read the book  
I know He's here, but I don't look  
Near as often as I should  
Yeah, I know I should  
His fingerprints are everywhere  
I'd just slow down to stop and stare  
Opened my eyes and man I swear  
I saw God today  
  
I saw a couple walking by they were holding hands  
Man, she had that glow  
Yeah I couldn't help but notice she was starting to show  
It stood there for a minute takin' the sky  
Lost in that sunset  
A splash of amber melted in the shades of red  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got my face pressed up against the nursery glass  
She's sleeping like a rock  
My name on her wrist wearing tiny pink socks  
She's got my nose, she's got her mama's eyes  
My brand new baby girl  
She's a miracle  
I saw God today

George Strait,I Should Have Watched That First Step,"I once had a love, a true and lasting love  
But the fool in me came out one night  
And with her loving eyes she saw right through my eyes  
And she changed the night I stepped across the line  
  
I should have watched that first step  
It was a mighty big step when I started steppin' out of line  
Though she's still lovin' me, it's not the way it used to be  
That first step did something to her mind

And the love we had will never be the same

George Strait,If I Know Me,"We both said some things I know we never meant,

If I know you, you're probably wonderin' what to do.  
You're thinkin' that I'm gone for good, if I know you.  
  
But if I know me, I'll turn this car around.  
I won't get halfway through town, and I'll be sorry.  
I'll stop and call, and you'll say you're sorry too,  
And I'll come runnin' back to you, if I know me.  
  
Sometimes I lose my head, say things to break your heart,  
Forgettin' if I lost your love, it would tear my world apart.  
If I know you, you didn't mean one single thing you said.  
Truth be known, you're dyin', cryin', lyin' there in bed.

George Strait,It Was Me,"The first time I met her  
She walked right up to me and said you're who I've wanted to find.  
There was a man she had seen in her dreams and it was me.  
She said I can't believe it cause I've never been in here  
And I've passed this so many times.  
It was her night to find destiny and it was Me  
  
And we danced every song that they played, and talked until closing time  
The closer I held her, the more I knew her destiny wasn't that far from mine.  
Then I saw a reflection of someone unfamiliar looking back when I looked in
her eyes  
The happiest man I'd ever seen and it was me  
  
And we danced every song that they played and talked until closing time.  
The closer I held her, the more I knew her destiny wasn't that far from mine.  
She wasn't looking and I wasn't looking,  
Ain't it funny? Thats when love was found.  
She still calls it her lucky night,  
Yes someone was lucky she's right  
But it was me.  
It was me  
It was me

","The first time I met her  
She walked right up to me and said you're who I've wanted to find.  
There was a man she had seen in her dreams and it was me.  
She said I can't believe it cause I've never been in here  
And I've passed this so many times.  
It was her night to find destiny and it was Me  
  
And we danced every song that they played, and talked until closing time  
The closer I held her, the more I knew her destiny wasn't that far from mine.  
Then I saw a reflection of someone unfamiliar looking back when I looked in
her eyes  
The happiest man I'd ever seen and it was me  
  
And we danced every song that they played and talked until closing time.  
The closer I held her, the more I knew her destiny wasn't that far from mine.  
She wasn't looking and I wasn't looking,  
Ain't it funny? Thats when love was found.  
She still calls it her lucky night,  
Yes someone was lucky she's right  
But it was me.  
It was me  
It was me"

And get to know this feeling that's so strong  
Lead on  
  
She said, I had a love once  
But he just up and left me  
I said I bet it broke your heart  
I had a love once to but  
I acted like a fool  
Oh what I'd give to be back in her arms  
  
Then she smiled and said the invitations open  
Cause you look just like what I've been waiting on.  
So I said why don't we take  
This matter somewhere else  
And pick up right where everything went wrong  
Lead on  
  
She said I don't recall  
Seeing you around here  
You must be new to this town"
George Strait,"Leavin's Been Comin' (For A Long, Long Time)","It's never over 'til it's really over

George Strait,Lefty's Gone,"A jukebox introduced us, when the sixties were still young.  
""If You've Got the Money, Honey"" got my nickels one by one.  
I tried to imitate that song.  
It's not right, but Lefty's gone.  
  
""Always Late"" breaks my heart.  
In every song he sang, I played the part.  
I heard he was sad, and lived alone.  
It's not right, but Lefty's gone.  
  
He played the fair in Dallas one year,  
In the cold October rain.  
Most folks stayed home and warm,  
But he sang just the same.  
I caught a chill before I got home.  
It's not right, but Lefty's gone.

George Strait,Lone Star Blues,"At a truck stop in St Angelo  
Saw a bill board about this rodeo  
This weekend out in El Paso  
So I signed up to ride  
  
I drew a bull called ""original sin""  
Heard he'd killed a couple of men  
Figured this was something I could win  
'Cause the devil was on my side  
I was havin' myself one hell of a ride  
But I ended up disqualified  
That bull just up and died  
Before they blew the whistle  
  
[Chorus]  
With those north Texas blues,  
Thought I'd paid all my dues  
Then those south Texas blues,  
Told me ""son, you ain't through""  
Had the east Texas blues and the west Texas too  
I've done all I know to do,  
Tryin' to lose, tryin' to lose,  
These ol' Lone Star Blues.  
  
Well I got laid off at Brown and Rue  
Then on my way back to cuttin' chute  
I lost my wrist watch and my boots  
Shootin' dice with a dude from Houston  
Well there ain't no jobs here workin' cattle  
So I got on the part time haulin' gravel  
With some outfit from Seattle out here building custom homes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I gassed my truck and I packed my clothes  
Turned in my key and I hit the road  
I said ""cow town's where I'll go,  
You never know, I might get lucky!""  
  
Well I got a friend there turning knobs  
At a place called Billy Bobs  
Said thought he could get me a job there  
Workin' as a bouncer  
First night on the job was just insane  
Some ol' boy got all deranged  
Hit me in the head with a Harley chain  
To this day, my ears still ring!

George Strait,Love Is Everything,"Love is everything

Tell me how can I run from something that I can't see?  
  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up.  
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug.  
It's a little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
  
Well I always thought that I had me a pretty good style,  
But I lost that race by a good old country mile.  
Well I was walking all around with my head held way up high,  
And it fooled me, hit me, really took me by surprise.  
  
Oh that little bitty teeny weeny thing they call the lovebug.  
Nobody's ever seen it, but it's got the whole world shook up.  
It all started with a little bitty kiss and a hug.

George Strait,Lover In Disguise,"There's a secret that I know about the lady that I love so  
And I'm the only one she's shown her secret to  
She's gentle and she's kind  
She's proper and refine  
But she lets down more than her hair  
Alone in our room  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause she's more than a lady  
And there's a fire that burns behind those eyes  
She's more than a lady  
And every night when we lay down  
And she slips off her satin gown  
Oh, she proves she's a lover in disguise  
She's a lover in disguise  
  
When we go out somewhere  
The men may stop and stare  
But they see she's a lady  
So they leave her alone  
She's more than she seems  
And in their wildest dreams  
They could never dream of what it's like to take her home

George Strait,Make Her Fall In Love With Me Song,"[chorus]  
Play me a dancer, a holder-hander, or honky-tonker,  
Pull-her-up-closer, slow romancer,  
Make her fall in love with me song.

But how's a fella supposed to get close to 'em?  
The band is rockin', the joint is jumpin,  
Mr. guitar man let me tell you somethin'

I see a redhead, I see a brunette,  
And there's a blonde I love I don't even know yet.

George Strait,Marina Del Rey,"We said goodbye in Marina del Rey  
""I had a good time""

And on the plane back to Tennessee  
My mind comes across her memory  
And yesterday  
In Marina del Rey  
  
[Chorus]  
On a hidden beach under a golden sun  
She spread a blanket that we laid down on  
And loved the world away  
In Marina del Rey  
And as we looked into each others' eyes  
We were lost in paradise  
Like two castaways  
In Marina del Rey  
  
Like the ocean tide's highs and lows  
Love sometimes comes and goes away  
In Marina del Rey  
And as this plane is touchin' down  
Tears touch my eyes for I have found  
My heart has stayed  
In Marina del Rey

George Strait,Meanwhile,"She sparkles, she dazzles, she lights up the room  
We walk together to a table for two  
Every man stares but her eyes are only for me  
We take to the dance floor, she squeezes my hand  
I can't believe just how lucky I am  
  
[Chorus]  
Meanwhile back in the back of my memory  
You're still dancing with me  
And I'm holding you once again  
Meanwhile  
  
We move to the end of a beautiful night  
Tender the kisses, soft candle light  
She draws the curtains, and slowly we climb up the stairs  
And reach for each other the passion begins  
We fall together as lovers and then,  
  
Meanwhile back in the back of my memory  
You're still lying with me  
And I'm holding you once again  
  
I try and I try, the Lord knows I do  
But each time my heart beats back to you  
  
Meanwhile I'll go on living my life now  
I'll find a way somehow  
Oh but, meanwhile back in the back of my memory  
You'll always be with me  
But I'll never hold you again  
Meanwhile.

George Strait,Middle Of Nowhere,"Way out here you can see for miles  
If there was anything to be seen  
Maybe I could tell the difference between  
Where I am and where I've been  
So if I stare off in the distance sometimes  
And get that far away look in my eye  
It's that my baby went and left me out there  
All alone in the middle of nowhere  
Way out in the middle of nowhere  
Oh nobody wants to go there  
My baby's gone and she don't care  
That I'm out here in the middle of nowhere  
Standin' at the edge of the sky  
On top of a mountain so tall  
Wishin' to God I could fly, fly, fly  
When I ain't even done climbin' the wall  
Could you help me let the teardrops roll  
Awe anything to cleanse my soul  
Or if you've got a single raindrop to spare  
Lord I'm out in the middle of nowhere  
Way out in the middle of nowhere  
Oh nobody wants to go there  
My baby's gone and she don't care  
That I'm out here in the middle of nowhere

George Strait,Murder On Music Row,"Nobody saw him running from sixteenth avenue.  
They never found the fingerprint or the weapon that was used.  
But someone killed country music, cut out its heart and soul.  
They got away with murder down on music row.  
  
The almighty dollar and the lust for worldwide fame  
Slowly killed tradition and for that someone should hang  
(oh, you tell them Alan).  
They all say not guilty, but the evidence will show  
That murder was committed down on music row.  
  
For the steel guitars no longer cry and fiddles barely play,  
But drums and rock 'n roll guitars are mixed up in your face.  
Old Hank wouldn't have a chance on today's radio  
Since they committed murder down on music row.  
  
They thought no one would miss it, once it was dead and gone  
They said no one would buy them old drinking and cheating songs (I'll still
buy'em)  
Well there ain't no justice in it and the hard facts are cold  
Murder's been committed down on music row.  
  
Oh, the steel guitars no longer cry and you can't hear fiddles play  
With drums and rock 'n roll guitars mixed right up in your face  
Why, the Hag, he wouldn't have a chance on today's radio  
Since they committed murder down on music row  
Why, they even tell the Possum to pack up and go back home  
There's been an awful murder down on music row.

I don't know just what it is  
That you're needing to hear me say  
The way that I'm feeling is more than mere words can describe  
All this discussion could never  
Do justice to something so heavenly-made  
I'd rather tell you With touches how I feel inside  
  
Let me hold you, let me show you  
What true love's all about  
In these arms of mine I know you will find  
You won't do without anymore  
I'll love you forever need I say more  
I'll love you forever need I say more"
George Strait,Neon Row,"You've been out again tonight  
With the girls out on the town  
But in those magic neon lights  
I know exactly what you found  
What about your home?  
And the man who loves you so  
Is it worth the thrill you feel down on neon row  
  
If you're lonely then your easy  
Them good ol' boys just pick and choose  
And lonely women are in season  
A one night stand's an all night lose  
And all those lonely high-heeled ladies  
Are always putting on a show  
But in the morning putting on coffee  
And putting back on the clothes they wore the night before  
To neon row  
  
Girl I can't hold you back  
Not one day longer

To keep you home  
Just start the fire  
To burn the bridges  
And maybe some night will lead in the magic light  
Down on neon row

George Strait,Noel Leon,"Leon Dixon leaves his Christmas lights up all year 'round  
It's somethin' different about our town  
We've often wondered why he never takes 'em down  
But Leon leaves his Christmas lights up all year 'round  
There's a big bright noel flashin' off and on  
In the yard where the children play the whole year long  
We've all gotten used to it year by year  
Now it's kinda gotten to be a part of things 'round here  
  
[Chorus]  
Peace on earth, Good will to men  
Christmas time is here again  
Can it be all that wrong  
To feel like Christmas all year long  
  
Leon got sick, it's been back awhile  
Short on luck and money, but he still wore that smile  
And nobody could stand to see him do without  
So we all drove over to see if we could help out  
Yeah, the noel flashed on and the bills stayed paid  
I felt so warm as we drove away  
I had never seen Christmas spelled so clear  
As when I saw ?LEON? flashin' in my rear view mirror

Gordon Lightfoot,A Message To The Wind,"I saw a moonlit scene, I never will forget  
I stole a kiss at daybreak, I never did regret it  
Sometimes I wonder why I even try  
So why should I feel blue?  
I heard the sound of footsteps swaying in the dark  
I poked my head out silent, that's how it started  
What to my eyes appeared as dust  
Became a vision I don't know  
What had finally found me with my back against the wall  
Was destiny intruding all around me  
And as the day wore on I knew  
Another lonely night could never be  
If there's is a reason you might try and forget  
I'd like to find it 'cause I like to relive it  
Sometimes I wonder why I ever cry  
So why should I feel blue?  
I was caught drifting disappearing from the land  
Whitecaps in profusion all around me  
But somehow in our eyes I found the strength  
To sail upon the raging sea  
If theres a reason for the way that life is  
I'd like to find it after all who's life is it  
Sometimes I wonder why I even try  
So why should I feel blue?  
What had finally found me with my back against the wall  
Was destiny intruding all around me  
And as the days wore on I knew

As I love thee  
  
I have no gold to give her  
Nor gowns of soft crimson hue  
Nor poems of love no rhymes to bring her  
Into my heart so strong so true

Gordon Lightfoot,A Painter Passing Through,"Once upon a time I was on my own  
Once upon a time like you've never known  
Once upon a time I would be impressed  
Once upon a time my life would be obsessed  
Once upon a time, once upon a day  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin' after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history  
Yesterday is gone, yesterday's alright  
Yesterday belongs in my dreams at night  
Yesterday is swell, yesterday is great  
Yesterday is strong, remembering can wait  
Once upon a time, once upon a day  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know an answer I can't turn your life around  
For I am just a painter passing through the underground  
I was in my stride, always at my game  
Here comes mister cool along the walk of fame  
I was in demand, always in control  
The world was in my hands, my touch had turn to gold  
Once upon a time, I was in a daze  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history  
Now that I am old, let me rest a spell  
All that I am told, I can never tell  
Never in my life, never will it pass  
I am still alone, remembering at last  
Once upon a time, once upon a day

Once upon a time, once upon a day  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin' after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history  
Yesterday is gone, yesterday's alright  
Yesterday belongs in my dreams at night  
Yesterday is swell, yesterday is great  
Yesterday is strong, remembering can wait  
Once upon a time, once upon a day  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know an answer I can't turn your life around  
For I am just a painter passing through the underground  
I was in my stride, always at my game  
Here comes mister cool along the walk of fame  
I was in demand, always in control  
The world was in my hands, my touch had turn to gold  
Once upon a time, I was in a daze  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history  
Now that I am old, let me rest a spell  
All that I am told, I can never tell  
Never in my life, never will it pass  
I am still alone, remembering at last  
Once upon a time, once upon a day  
When I was in my prime, once along the way  
If you want to know an answer I can't turn your life around  
For I am just a painter passing through the underground  
If you want to know my secret don't come runnin after me  
For I am just a painter passing through in history"
Gordon Lightfoot,A Tree Too Weak To Stand,"I see a place where candles burn and lovers rest tonight  
The hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write  
But songs of love will never leave love's feelings undefiled  
The tide has turned, the waves roll in, the waters fill my eyes  
  
The price of lust has risen till the ceiling will not stand  
The tears I shed were not in shame, the world was in my hands  
If trust was just a simple thing then trusting I would be  
But deep within my soul I know it's better to be free  
  
The days fly by, the waves roll in, but freedom has not come  
I fear my faith will soon give out, my senses come undone  
My role is played, the demon dogs come stealin' o'er land  
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand  
  
I see a place where candles burn and lovers rest tonight  
The hollow sound inside me now keeps telling me to write  
But songs of love should not be sung where staying is not planned  
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand  
And foolish I would climb once more a tree too weak to stand

Gordon Lightfoot,Affair On 8Th Avenue,"The perfume that she wore was from some little store  
On the down side of town  
But it lingered on long after she'd gone  
I remember it well  
And our fingers entwined like ribbons of light  
And we came through a doorway somewhere in the night  
Her long flowing hair came softly undone  
And it lay all around  
And she brushed it down as I stood by her side  
In the warmth of her love  
And she showed me her treasures of paper and tin  
And we played a game only she could win  
And she told me a riddle I'll never forget  
Then left with the answer I've never found yet  
""How long"", said she, ""Can a moment like this  
Belong to someone?""  
""What's wrong, what is right, when to live or to die  
We must almost be born""  
So if you should ask me what secrets I hide  
I'm only your lover, don't make me decide

Gordon Lightfoot,All I'm After,"All I'm after is to be on your winning side  
All I need is to be turning back the tide  
'Cause I care too much for the life that I lead  
What you're thinking could be anybody's guess  
  
All I'm after is the sun and the summer nights  
By the seashore, don't want no more neon lights  
Just the sand and the sky as the hours roll by  
Ain't it funny, how the world seems to be back there in my dreams  
All I see is my reflection in your wild and winsome ways  
Ain't it funny, life feels different every day  
  
All I'm after is to be the flame in your tattoo  
Be the one girl who can thrill me through and through  
This is just a guess but I must confess  
It feels better being certain  
Please excuse my truthfulness  
What I'm seeing's worth believing  
When you thrill me like you do  
So you wonder why my feelings never fade  
I think I got it made  
  
In the evening when the rain begins to fall  
That's when I wonder if you think of me at all  
But you sound so sad, in your special way  
Ain't it funny, life feels different with each new passing day  
All I need is my reflection in your wild and windswept ways  
Ain't it funny how life changes every day

Gordon Lightfoot,Apology,"I remember everything  
I've learned about survival  
I've walked with fools and kings  
And I've even read the bible  
There I came upon some lines  
Givin' me direction  
Gather not your gold on earth  
Your kingdom is in heaven  
But I chose to live instead  
Inside the shell they gave me  
'til in spite of everything  
Good fortune came to find me  
I tried my best to run away  
But I could not avoid the feelin'  
Soon I was reelin' on my feet  
I made a grab at anything  
The earth was gone and I was on  
A vicious circle then  
After I'd gone and let myself surrender  
I didn't want to die at all  
I thought I'd live forever  
Then she gave me everything  
A king could never borrow  
But I twisted all her gifts  
Her wisdom was my sorrow  
So I left her cryin'  
And roamed across the river  
The angels offered me their hands  
But I could not forget her  
So I came to where she was  
By river, road and reason  
I slept beneath her window  
In the moonlight summer season  
But I could not go inside  
I heard the sound of laughter  
And the rustle of her hair upon his skin  
I made a grab at anything  
The earth was gone and I was on  
A vicious circle then  
After I'd gone to cry down my sorrow  
I didn't want to live no more  
Nor face the bright tomorrow  
Then I remembered everything

Havin' walked with fools and kings  
I've even read the bible  
I remember all those lines

Gather not your gold on earth  
It will not pass inspection  
And still I think when I'm alone  
Away from all night splendor  
If gold could buy one night with her  
I wish I had some to send her

Gordon Lightfoot,Approaching Lavender,"If you'd like to spend the afternoon approaching Lavender  
You'll feel just fine but one thing's sure  
You'll never be the same  
If you'd like to try your hand at understanding Lavender  
Then you must be very sure  
That life is not a game  
You might even learn a thing or two approaching Lavender  
You'll soon be on a one night tour  
Forgetting your own name  
You won't need a reason just to be alone with Lavender  
For the light so warm and pure  
Will draw you like a flame  
The colors that surround you there will be the shade of Lavender  
Shadows dancing everywhere  
Like flowers in the rain  
You will find your tongue's on fire while lying next to Lavender  
With words you never spoke before  
And will not speak again  
Oh sweet Lavender, I understand you perfectly  
There is no way that I can see  
You living by yourself  
Oh sweet Lavender, I must be with you constantly  
Your presence means so much to me  
Much more that life itself  
Oh sweet Lavender, as fragrant as the name you bear  
Please cast away the clothes you wear  
And give your love to me  
Oh sweet Lavender, your smile is like the golden sun  
I'd love to see you laugh and run  
As naked as the sea  
If you'd like to spend the afternoon approaching Lavender  
Don't try and get the best of her  
She will not share the blame  
If you'd like to try your hand at understanding Lavender  
Then you must be very sure  
That life is not a game  
There is no shame

Gordon Lightfoot,Can't Depend On Love,"I spent most of my life outside, in the driving rain  
I was only trying to get by with some of life's amenities  
Well, nothing's free, I got more than I bargained for  
Now it's plain to see, I can't depend on love to defend me  
It took most of my time to do what never was done  
I was on the outside of an inside kind of love that now is gone  
Come right or wrong, it was laid to rest that way  
I hate to be unkind, pretending is for strangers who don't know you  
I spent most of my life outside in the driving rain  
I was in some one-horse town just waiting for a plane  
To take me back now where's that at, I paid the price  
Well, ain't that nice, knowing I'm so free?  
I can't depend on love to defend me  
I got more than I bargained for  
Now it's plain to see, I can't depend on love to defend me

Gordon Lightfoot,Carefree Highway,"Pickin' up the pieces of my sweet shattered dream

Her name was Ann and I'll be damned if I recall her face  
She left me not knowin' what to do  
Carefree highway, let me slip away on you

Gordon Lightfoot,Changes,"Sit by my side come as close as the air  
Sharin' a memory of grey  
And wander in my words  
And dream about the pictures that I play  
Of changes  
  
Green leaves of summer turn red in the fall  
To brown and to yellow they fade  
And then they have to die  
Trapped within the circle time parade  
Of changes  
  
Moments of magic will glow in the night  
All fears of the forest are gone  
For when the morning breaks  
They're swept away by golden drops of dawn  
Of changes  
  
Passions will part to a warm melody  
As fires will sometimes turn cold  
Like petals in the wind  
We're puppets to the silver strings of souls  
Of changes  
  
Your tears will be trembling now we're somewhere else  
One last cup of wine we will pour  
I'll kiss you one more time  
And leave you on the rolling river shore  
Of changes

Gordon Lightfoot,Christian Island,"I'm sailing down the summer wind  
I got whiskers on my chin  
And I like the mood I'm in  
As I while away the time of day  
In the lee of Christian Island  
  
Tall and strong she dips and reels  
I call her Silver Heels  
And she tells me how she feels  
She's a good old boat and she'll stay afloat  
Through the toughest gales and keep smiling  
But for one more day she would like to stay  
In the lee of Christian Island  
  
I'm sailing down the summer day  
Where fish and seagulls play  
I put my troubles all away  
And when the gale comes up I'll fill my cup  
With the whiskey of the highlands  
She's a good old ship and she'll make the trip  
From the lee of Christian Island  
  
Tall and strong she slips along  
I sing for her a song  
And she leans into the wind  
She's a good old boat and she'll stay afloat  
Through the toughest gales and keep smilin'  
When the summer ends we will rest again  
In the lee of Christian Island

Gordon Lightfoot,Circle Of Steel,"Rows of lights in a circle of steel  
Where you place your bets on a great big wheel  
High windows flickerin' down through the snow  
A time you know  
Sights and sounds of the people goin' 'round  
Everybody's in step with the season  
  
A child is born to a welfare case  
Where the rats run around like they own the place  
The room is chilly, the building is old  
That's how it goes  
The doctor's found on his welfare round  
And he comes and he leaves on the double  
  
Deck The Halls was the song they played  
In the flat next door where they shout all day  
She tips her gin bottle back till it's gone  
The child is strong  
A week, a day, they will take it away  
For they know about all her bad habits  
  
Christmas dawns and the snow lets up  
And the sun hits the handle of her heirloom cup  
She hides her face in her hands for a while  
Says look here child  
Your father's pride was his means to provide  
And he's servin' three years for that reason

Gordon Lightfoot,Cold Hands From New York,"I came down through Albany to New York  
To find what I'd been missin'  
I looked across the river to the city  
Where the windows all stood glistenin'  
I stood listenin'  
Into a tunnel I did rise, like a grave inside  
But I was young and able  
When I came out the other end  
Ah through the smoke, the winter light was feeble  
Unreadable  
I was optimistic though, a cabbie told me where to go  
I thanked him  
A face of white, a face of brown  
Ah here a smile and there a look of danger  
For a stranger  
It was too unreal for me  
I found no one who trusted me  
There was no man could offer me  
A cold hand from New York  
Cold hands from New York  
A voice within you cries, ""Won't someone please help me  
I'll do the same for you one day  
If you should ever pass my way and need me""  
I came down to live alone in New York  
The city of the living  
There were fortunes at my feet but most of men  
Were taking, none we giving  
Or forgiving  
Children ran and children played and roses grew in alleyways  
I saw them  
There were men who lived in style and others who had died  
Where no one knew them  
Beause they couldn't win  
There were parks where old men slept and dingy rooms  
Where babies crept unwanted  
Till I began to ask myself if there were hope  
Or if it mattered what they did  
Or if they lived  
It was too unreal for me  
I found no one who trusted me  
There was no man could offer me

I looked across the river to the city  
Where the windows all stood glistenin'  
I stood listenin'  
And there were prophets in the squares  
And people there who smiled and said, ""Forget it""  
There were lovers in the park  
And there was danger in the dark, I felt it  
So afraid of it  
And there were preachers of the Word and poets  
Who were never heard, I heard them  
There were those who would not try to learn  
The measure of the lie they're livin'  
I heard a young musician play in a place  
Where they paid you not to listen  
I heard a woman scream for help while men stood by  
And offered their best wishes  
That's how it is

Gordon Lightfoot,Cotton Jenny,"There's a house on a hill  
By a worn down weathered old mill  
In the valley below where the river winds  
There's no such thing as bad times  
And a soft southern flame  
Oh Cotton Jenny's her name  
She wakes me up when the sun goes down  
And the wheels of love go 'round  
Wheels of love go 'round  
Love go 'round, love go 'round  
A joyful sound  
I ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend  
But then the wheels go 'round  
  
When the new day begins  
I go down to the cotton gin  
And I make my time worth while to them  
Then I climb back up again  
And she waits by the door  
Oh Cotton Jenny I'm sore  
And she rubs my feet while the sun goes down  
And the wheels of love go 'round  
  
Wheels of love go 'round  
Love go 'round, love go 'round  
A joyful sound  
I ain't got a penny for Cotton Jenny to spend  
But then the wheels go 'round  
  
In the hot, sickly South  
When they say we'll shut my mouth  
I can never be free from the cotton grind  
But I know I got what's mine  
She's a soft southern flame  
Oh Cotton Jenny's her name  
She wakes me up when the sun goes down  
And the wheels of love go 'round  
  
Wheels of love go 'round  
Love go 'round, love go 'round

Gordon Lightfoot,Couchiching,"There's a town they call Orillia, It is there of which I sing.  
It is just above Lake Simcoe, by Lake Couchiching.  
  
-Chorus-  
Couchiching, Couchiching, by Lake Couchiching.  
Cooooochiching, by Lake Couchiching.  
Couchiching, Couchiching, by Lake Couchiching,  
Coooochiching  
  
Across the raging Narrows, Casino Rama stands.  
Where there once were only sparrows, people come from other lands.  
To the west lie hills aplenty, if skiing is your thing,  
You can while away the summer, by Lake Couchiching.  
  
-Chorus-  
  
In Orillia they had movies, and sports and music too.  
And all around the shore line, were the folks that we all knew.  
  
-Chorus-  
  
Now I've spent my life in travel, now I've spent my life in dust.  
Now I've spent my life in family, now I've spent my life in trust.  
Any way you'd like to cut in, It'll hit you with a ping.  
When you think about Orillia, and it's by Lake Couchiching.  
  
-Chorus-  
  
When I get my final slumber, when I pawn my diamond ring,  
I will do my final number, by Lake Couchiching.

Gordon Lightfoot,Crossroads,"When first I did appear upon this native soil  
All up and down this country at labor I did toil  
I slumbered in the moonlight and I rose with the sun  
I rambled through the canyons where the cold rivers run  
  
When first I did come down where the land meets the sea  
The people said Who are you and what would your name be  
I said I have no home and I am no man's son  
'Twas inland I was born and from inland that I come  
  
In the good land I was young and I was strong  
No one dared to call me son  
Happy just to see my day's work done  
See my day's work done  
  
So I swung an axe as a timberjack  
And I worked the Quebec mines  
And on the golden prairie I rode the big combines  
I sailed the maritime waters of many a seaport town  
Built the highways and the byways to the western salmon grounds  
  
I've gazed upon the good times I've seen the bad times too  
Felt many a cold and bitter wind and many a mornin' dew  
I've watched the country growin' like a fair and mighty thing  
And on the still of a summer night I've heard the mountains ring  
  
In the good land I was young and I was strong  
No one dared to call me son  
Happy just to see my day's work done  
See my day's work done  
  
But now the seeds are planted and the gates are open wide  
The old ways are forgotten there's no place left to hide  
And the legacy I'm leavin' you is not very hard to find  
You'll see it all around you at this crossroads of time  
In the sweet soil it's a-growin' At the crossroads of time

Gordon Lightfoot,Did She Mention My Name,"It's so nice to meet an old friend and pass the time of day

Is the ice still on the river, are the old folks still the same  
And by the way, did she mention my name  
  
Did she mention my name just in passing  
And when the morning came, do you remember if she dropped a name or two  
Is the home team still on fire, do they still win all the games  
And by the way, did she mention my name  
  
Is the landlord still a loser, do his signs hang in the hall

Does the laughter on their faces still put the sun to shame  
And by the way, did she mention my name  
  
Did she mention my name just in passing

Gordon Lightfoot,Don Quixote,"Through the woodland, through the valley  
Comes a horseman wild and free  
Tilting at the windmills passing  
Who can the brave young horseman be  
He is wild but he is mellow  
He is strong but he is weak  
He is cruel but he is gentle  
He is wise but he is meek  
  
Reaching for his saddlebag  
He takes a battered book into his hand  
Standing like a prophet bold  
He shouts across the ocean to the shore  
Till he can shout no more  
  
I have come o'er moor and mountain  
Like the hawk upon the wing  
I was once a shining knight  
Who was the guardian of a king  
I have searched the whole world over  
Looking for a place to sleep  
I have seen the strong survive  
And I have seen the lean grown weak  
  
See the children of the earth  
Who wake to find the table bare  
See the gentry in the country  
Riding off to take the air  
  
Reaching for his saddlebag  
He takes a rusty sword into his hand  
Then striking up a knightly pose  
He shouts across the ocean to the shore  
Till he can shout no more  
  
See the jailor with his key  
Who locks away all trace of sin  
See the judge upon the bench  
Who tries the case as best he can  
See the wise and wicked ones  
Who feed upon life's sacred fire  
See the soldier with his gun  
Who must be dead to be admired  
  
See the man who tips the needle  
See the man who buys and sells  
See the man who puts the collar  
On the ones who dare not tell  
See the drunkard in the tavern  
Stemming gold to make ends meet  
See the youth in ghetto black  
Condemned to life upon the street  
  
Reaching for his saddlebag  
He takes a tarnished cross into his hand  
Then standing like a preacher now  
He shouts across the ocean to the shore  
Then in a blaze of tangled hooves  
He gallops off across the dusty plain  
In vain to search again

Gordon Lightfoot,Drifters,"I don't believe in miracles if it's all the same by you  
Your wishes would come true if I had my say  
Whether it's right or wrong, the words of every song  
Remind us of a love we knew  
Where love should not go wrong, in yesterdays  
Hang on ye drifters now  
You got so much to go and gamble on  
Watch out for the shifting sand  
Where ever you may ramble  
Even now, as I look back and see all that's come to pass  
I can't remember how it was I got here  
Look around this place, there's a smile on every face  
We're somewhere in the afterglow, out there among the stars  
Out there among the bars  
Hang on ye drifters now  
You got places to go and people to meet  
Watch out for the shifting tide  
Where ever you may travel  
I know I should not complain because life's been good to me  
It feels real good to be stranded on my own  
Be that as it may be, we are what we are  
I'll find you in the afterglow out there among the stars  
Of yesteryear  
Hang on ye drifters now  
You got so much to go and gamble on  
Watch out for the shifting sand  
Where ever you may ramble  
All you drifters now  
You got places to go and people to meet  
Watch out for the shifting tide  
Where ever you may travel  

","I don't believe in miracles if it's all the same by you  
Your wishes would come true if I had my say  
Whether it's right or wrong, the words of every song  
Remind us of a love we knew  
Where love should not go wrong, in yesterdays  
Hang on ye drifters now  
You got so much to go and gamble on  
Watch out for the shifting sand  
Where ever you may ramble  
Even now, as I look back and see all that's come to pass  
I can't remember how it was I got here  
Look around this place, there's a smile on every face  
We're somewhere in the afterglow, out there among the stars  
Out there among the bars  
Hang on ye drifters now  
You got places to go and people to meet  
Watch out for the shifting tide  
Where ever you may travel  
I know I should not complain because life's been good to me  
It feels real good to be stranded on my own  
Be that as it may be, we are what we are  
I'll find you in the afterglow out there among the stars

Gordon Lightfoot,Drink Yer Glasses Empty,"Listen up and I'll tell you what you'll do

Drink yer glasses empty now  
Was all that they were told  
Drink yer glasses empty now  
It's time to hit the sky  
To the tune of thunder

Gordon Lightfoot,Early Mornin' Rain,"In the early mornin' rain  
With a dollar in my hand  
And an aching in my heart  
And my pockets full of sand  
I'm a long ways from home  
And I missed my loved one so  
In the early mornin' rain  
With no place to go  
  
Out on runway number nine  
Big seven o seven set to go  
Well I'm out here on the grass  
Where the pavement never grows  
Where the liquor tasted good  
And the women all were fast  
There she goes my friend  
She's rolling out at last  
  
Hear the mighty engines roar  
See the silver wing on high  
She's away and westward bound  
For above the clouds she flies  
Where the mornin' rain don't fall  
And the sun always shines  
She'll be flying over my home  
In about three hours time  
  
This ol' airport's got me down  
It's no earthly good to me  
Cause I'm stuck here on the ground  
Cold and drunk as I might be  
Can't jump a jet plane  
Like you can a freight train  
So I best be on my way

Gordon Lightfoot,East Of Midnight,"Put me somewhere east of midnight  
West of the turnpike  
Anywhere I wander  
Is where I'll take my rest  
As I lie down, toss some thoughts around  
Dreams I'm told will come true if you  
Believe in those who love you right now  
Sea of dreams I long for you  
Forget about the others  
This is my hike, you can come if you like  
To feel good, I would help you if I could  
But I am out here searching  
For the things that might have been  
I need no more reminders  
Not one love letter have I seen  
And that's a pretty good start  
The ocean is where lovers meet again  
Sea of dreams by all means  
Float me out of danger until then  
Forever amen  
It's a long, long hike  
We'll be leavin' early travelin' light  
That's alright heaven will be ours tonight  
The road is paved with moonbeams  
There are faces that I knew  
They all came back to haunt me  
But that ain't fair to the folks like me and you  
It takes a bit of my heart  
Tonight I shall be watching from the shore  
Sea of dreams from now on  
Forget about all the others  
Back where the line forms  
Destination sea of storms  
By all means ever onward sea of dreams  
Put me somewhere east of midnight  
Along about daylight  
Anywhere I wander  
Is where I'll take my rest  
If we could just lie down, love  
Toss some thoughts around

Gordon Lightfoot,Ecstasy Made Easy,"I can always try to forget somehow  
What's a part of the past  
Have a little laughter if you please  
I won't even mind if it takes awhile  
I've got time on my hands  
I feel another chapter in the breeze  
And somebody touched my heart string  
Somebody made my heart sing  
And somebody stole my heart away  
Nobody's sayin' their sorry  
It's a mighty sweet music  
You can dance all night  
Put some wood on the fire right now  
Ecstasy made easy  
Ecstasy I ask you, are you a name  
Or just another patron with a smile?  
Let me analyze you, are you a flame  
Or just the dying embers of a kiss run wild?  
Somebody found my heart string  
Somebody made my heart sing  
And somebody touched my heart last night  
Somebody set me in flight  
It's a mighty sweet music  
Take a chance they say  
Put flame on the old iron stove  
Ecstasy made easy  
It's a mighty sweet music  
Take a chance they say  
Put some fire on the old iron stove  
Ecstasy made easy, made easy  
I hope I never lose what belongs to me  
By the right of my birth  
At midnight sailing out of Perth  
Getting under way we turned westward bound  
On that southern sea  
To sea what ecstasy was worth

Gordon Lightfoot,Fading Away,"I was at the break wall, I was lookin' at the sea  
In back of the eight ball in some misery  
There on the horizon stood a mighty ship of fools  
They were headin' into the harbor with all their broken rules  
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
They're better off to be someplace that's a good long way from home  
Any way I can lose myself  
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'  
I'm fading away, fading away  
They sailed right up to me, I said, ""What's it all about  
Please try to excuse me, we can work things out  
If you've ever wondered if that mighty ship is real  
Let me tell ya 'bout it, brother, it was somethin' you could feel""  
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely, I let twilight set the tone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone  
They're better off to be someplace, that's a good long way to roam  
Ain't livin' high on the hog right now  
Dawn is breakin', I'm hesitatin'  
I'm fading away, fading away  
One more day on the calendar in my mind  
I am down at the break wall puttin' in some time  
The whole ship of fools has gotten safely under way  
And I was proud to be a part of what it was they had to say  
Whenever I'm feelin' lonely I can just pick up the phone  
Or I can go to the movies or just stay at home alone

How did it feel when I looked through your soul  
When was the last time you wanted my love  
How many nights did you cry your dreams to sleep  
Why did you hide what you knew would not stay hidden  
How could you put yourself through like you did  
I'm not the kind that would hold you that way  
Drop me a line if ya wake up feelin' bad

In this hangdog hotel room

A little monkeyshines

Is playin' in tune on time  
With rhythms all around us  
We're like weavers at the loom  
So pass the jar and that old guitar  
In this hangdog hotel room  
  
Oh Lord it feels so good  
To play a nighttime tune  
So pass the jar and that old guitar  
In this hangdog hotel room  
  
When it comes to mornin'  
And goin' out at night  
Well the kind of test that I like the best  
Is rubbin' the wrong girl right  
And a few good friends and neighbors  
In to playin' the nighttime tunes

Gordon Lightfoot,Heaven Help The Devil,"In this land of chance do we know right from wrong  
Even at a glance we know the road is long  
We don't owe a single thing to anyone  
  
Most of us do not believe in come what may  
Everything we fought for was in vain they say  
Even when called upon to throw our lives away  
  
We have been captured by the thieves of the night  
Held for ransom if you please  
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories  
  
In these times of trial and uncertainty  
I have thought what does this freedom mean to me  
Is it just some long forgotten fantasy  
  
Our love for each other may not be explained  
We live in a world where tears must fall like rain  
Most of us don't wish to cause each other pain  
  
We have been captured by the thieves of the night  
Held for ransom if you please  
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasnt memories  
  
To every unsung hero in the universe  
To those who roam the skies and those who roam the earth  
To all good men of reason may they never thirst  
  
We have wings to guide us through the timeless sea  
And faith that will remain through all eternity  
We try to be helpful to the ones in need  
  
We have been captured by the thieves of the night  
Held for ransom if you please  
Heaven help the devil may he have a few unpleasant memories

Gordon Lightfoot,Home From The Forest,"Oh the neon lights were flashin'  
And the icy wind did blow  
The water seeped into his shoes  
And the drizzle turned to snow  
His eyes were red, his hopes were dead  
And the wine was runnin' low  
And the old man came home  
From the forest  
  
His tears fell on the sidewalk  
As he stumbled in the street  
A dozen faces stopped to stare  
But no one stopped to speak  
For his castle was a hallway  
And the bottle was his friend  
And the old man stumbled in  
From the forest  
  
Up a dark and dingy staircase  
The old man made his way  
His ragged coat around him  
As upon his cot he lay  
And he wondered how it happened  
That he ended up this way  
Getting lost like a fool  
In the forest  
  
And as he lay there sleeping  
A vision did appear  
Upon his mantle shining  
A face of one so dear  
Who had loved him in the springtime  
Of a long-forgotten year  
When the wildflowers did bloom  
In the forest  
  
She touched his grizzled fingers  
And she called him by his name  
And then he heard the joyful sound  
Of children at their games  
In an old house on a hillside  
In some forgotten town  
Where the river runs down  
From the forest  
  
With a mighty roar the big jets soar  
Above the canyon streets  
And the con men con but life goes on  
For the city never sleeps  
And to an old forgotten soldier  
The dawn will come no more  
For the old man has come home  
From the forest

Gordon Lightfoot,I'd Do It Again,"A one man band on a one night stand  
As a one man band should be

And he played one just for free  
The sounds he laid down. the songs he played  
Made the ladies all come to call

On the road to Niagara Falls  
  
I'd do it again, I'd do it again

I seen the high rollers come and go  
It's the holy rollers I trust

He retired from the county school  
A wee bit thin with a will to begin  
He was known to be know man's fool

I'd do it again  
  
The one man band was a mighty good man  
Cause he played 'til the break of dawn  
He ups and downs about four more rounds  
And he stayed 'til the crowd went home  
It seemed to me like he never could be  
Like anything I'd ever seen before  
When he stepped from the stage  
With his ax in his hand

Till you live life in solitaire where  
No one knows your name

I will be with you right up until  
The spell is broken and all is well

Well, I sure can understand  
Are you too wrapped up in your own scene

Gordon Lightfoot,If Children Had Wings,"There's a love I hold dear  
And it shines through each year  
And it makes things seem different somehow  
It's for better or worse  
It's for people who thirst  
For a love that burns brighter right now  
  
And it shines on and on 'til all sadness is gone  
And if children had wings I would sing them this song  
With a smile on my face and a tear in my eye  
Everything will be fine by and by  
  
There were things that were said  
There were things that were done  
And a wife cannot stand too much pain  
And what I thought was best  
Couldn't please her much less  
But my love still goes on, that don't change

Gordon Lightfoot,If It Should Please You,"If it should please you, I have come to play

And a few good songs about the old highway  
I been around so long, Lord, I guess, I'm here to stay  
So I'm itching to please you with a topical song  
And a few golden oldies and a little hoedown  
And I think, I know how to make you feel

I have seen the best of all those things you can't explain

Gordon Lightfoot,I'll Tag Along,"You've got time enough for two of us  
What is mine, I will share  
We've got things that we can do without  
Most anytime, anywhere  
Every little daydream that appears in all we do  
Gives us some problems of our own  
If you turn back to that page again  
And you can't win, if you ask me, I'll tag along  
Paper matches in the afternoon  
Cups of tea and all of that Zen  
I think, it's time we took a walk outside  
It seems there is no oxygen  
This time tomorrow, we might all be packed and gone  
I believe, it's best we carry on  
Smoke rings rising 'til they disappear  
In the sky above, if you ask me, I'll tag along  
Each and every bad dream will be hammered into dust  
When we get back where we belong  
If you ever turn that page again  
You need a friend, if you ask me, I'll tag along  
This time tomorrow, we might all be packed and gone  
I believe, it's best we carry on  
Smoke rings rising 'til they disappear  
In the sky above, if you ask me, I'll tag along  

","You've got time enough for two of us  
What is mine, I will share  
We've got things that we can do without  
Most anytime, anywhere  
Every little daydream that appears in all we do  
Gives us some problems of our own  
If you turn back to that page again  
And you can't win, if you ask me, I'll tag along  
Paper matches in the afternoon  
Cups of tea and all of that Zen  
I think, it's time we took a walk outside  
It seems there is no oxygen  
This time tomorrow, we might all be packed and gone  
I believe, it's best we carry on  
Smoke rings rising 'til they disappear  
In the sky above, if you ask me, I'll tag along  
Each and every bad dream will be hammered into dust  
When we get back where we belong  
If you ever turn that page again  
You need a friend, if you ask me, I'll tag along  
This time tomorrow, we might all be packed and gone

Gordon Lightfoot,It's Worth Believin',"There's a warm wind tonight

Gordon Lightfoot,Love And Maple Syrup,"Love and maple syrup goes together  
Like the sticky winds of winter when they meet  
When lonely lovers come to rest  
Beneath the trees they do their best  
But still they can't be free  
Looking for the world to be  
Anything but what they see  
Longing to be understood  
By the heart that shapes the wood  
  
If you go into the forest, gaze up through the leaves  
And see the sky that's almost wild  
You must learn to understand  
What makes the forest greet the man  
Like a mother's only child  
  
In the north when when winter's claw  
Relaxes now to keep the laws of nature in control  
People come and stand in line  
To rob the forest of her wine  
But they don't feel the cold  
  
Looking for the world to be  
Anything but what they see  
Longing to be understood  
By the heart that shapes the wood  
  
Love and maple syrup goes together

When lonely lovers come to rest

But still they can't be free

Embers warm, like thoughts divine  
They tell us it is spring  
Love and maple syrup stir  
The thoughts of people into words  
Of songs that they can sing  
  
Looking for the world to be  
Anything but what they see  
Longing to be understood

Across the room into your mind they go  
Listen to the strings  
They jangle and dangle  
While the old guitar rings  
The minstrel of the dawn is he  
Not too wise but oh so free  
He'll talk of life out on the street  
He'll play it sad and say it sweet  
Look into his shining face  
Of lonelines you'll always find a trace  
Just like me and you  
He's tryin' to get into things  
More happy than blue

Go fetch some wine and set it there

And follow the fingers where they go  
Listen to the strings  
They jangle and dangle  
While the old guitar rings

He's like an old time troubador  
Just wanting life and nothing more  
Look into his shining eyes  
And if you see a ghost don't be surprised  
Like me and you

More happy than blue

The minstrel boy will understand  
He holds a promise in his hand  
He talks of better days ahead  
And by his words your fortune's read  
Listen to the pictures flow  
Across the room into your mind they go  
Listen to the strings  
They jangle and dangle  
While the old guitar rings  
  
The minstrel of the dawn is gone  
I hope he'll call before too long  
And if you meet him you must be  
The victim of his minstrelsy  
He'll sing for you a song  
The minstrel of the dawn"

Gordon Lightfoot,Never Too Close,"I remember when best friends were jealous lovers  
Lyin' warm asleep beneath the covers  
Dreaming of belonging to each other  
And so we tried, never too close  
Never too near, dyin' in time  
And so we cried but that is alright  
We meant no one no harm  
  
I remember when best friends were no mistaken  
Long before that freedom was forsaken

And so we cried but that is alright

When the days were warm and the nights more tender  
When the bonds of truth were not made to measure  
And so we tried, never too close

And so we cried but that is alright

Following dreams never fulfilled

Gordon Lightfoot,Nous Vivons Ensemble,"We've got to stay together  
We've got to find each other now  
That is how we can learn all about the other man's song  
On the plains of abraham  
When they sent the lamb to die  
You and I were asleep in the rock of ages  
Remember the unborn children still to come  
If you need me and I need you  
There's nothin' else needs sayin'  
Understand it  
I'm not too deaf to hear the song you're playin'

Gordon Lightfoot,Now And Then,"I think this time you've said enough  
To make me want to leave this place  
Still I keep coming back for more of  
The same to fan the dying flame  
Here inside these walls that seem  
To move a little closer every day  
There must be a way out of  
This crazy game we play out to the end  
Let us just pretend a while  
Think about the good things now and then  
  
I think this time that was the best time  
That we two had ever known  
We tried the handle of the house  
Upon the shore and found the open door  
Once inside we found a curious moonbeam  
Doing dances on the floor  
We were only playing like two children  
Who had stayed away from school  
Two of us could not be wrong  
Heaven knows who keeps the golden rule  
  
I think this time we've learned enough  
To know that nothing is the same  
But still the pounding of my heart  
Hasn't changed and leavin's so strange  
Here among my thoughts of you  
I find a gentle longing to be free  
There must be a way out of  
This crazy game we play out to the end  
Take away the in-between  
Think about the good things now and then  
We will see the day when you  
Or I will stay or face up to the end  
Let us just pretend a while  
And think about the good things now and then

Gordon Lightfoot,Ode To Big Blue,"The oceans of the world were the home of big blue  
He was the greatest monster that the world ever knew  
And the place that he loved best  
Was the waters to the west  
Around the blue Pacific he did roam  
  
Big Blue moved alone for a mighty blue was he  
And the battles of the whales was an awesome sight to see  
And he took them one by one and he drove them all away  
In the mating of the day he was the king  
  
Big blue had fifty wives and he sired forty sons  
Though most of them feel victim to the cruel harpoon guns  
Ah but he was too much wise to get caught by the gunners' eyes  
And so he lived at sea a hundred years  
  
His mouth was as large as a tunnel so they say  
His hide was thick as leather and his eyes quick and small  
And his back was all scarred by the times he got away  
And he knew the smell of whalers did Big Blue  
  
Big Blue passed away to his natural decay  
Beside the Arctic Circle as he travelled up that way  
And there never was a man who was born with a gunner's hand  
Who ever took a pan to Big Blue  
  
Now the gray whale has run and the sperm is almost done  
The finbacks and the Greenland rights have all passed and gone  
They've been taken by the men for the money they could spend  
And the killing never ends, it just goes on  
  
The oceans of the earth were the home of big blue  
He was the greatest monster that the world ever knew  
And the place that he loved best was the waters to the west  
Around the blue Pacific he did roam

Buyin' kingdoms with my songs  
Knowin' I'd be back in just a while  
Warm in the sunlight of her smile  
  
Well lots of time and songs have passed  
I catch myself just looking back  
Reliving all the wonder of those nights  
That's where I'd be today

Gordon Lightfoot,On Yonge Street,"See the people walkin' up and down  
See the people movin' all around  
On the streets of my hometown, on Yonge Street  
Longest street in the world they say  
Summertime soon slips away  
I hope I'll see you one fine day on Yonge Street  
Everywhere you go in a city by the lake  
Back there in the flow you may give a hand a shake  
Everyone you pass seems to wanna say hello  
Even late at night on the freshly fallen snow  
See the children jumpin' all around  
See the parents looking up and down  
Upon the streets of my hometown, on Yonge Street  
It's a mean street if you choose  
It's a lean street when you loose  
An' in between street when you cruise along Yonge Street  
Everywhere you go in a city by the lake  
You'll be sure and find it's a case of give and take

Only love would know, only love would know  
She lives on the other side, you wanna know the reason why  
She arrives at promises and you believe in what she says  
Everywhere you go  
Is the light of passion burnin' bright?  
Everywhere you go, only love would know  
You think, you've been wronged again  
Oh what a way to treat a friend  
She belongs to other eyes and surely you must realize  
She ain't the kind who would soon step aside  
Pay any dues at the expense of her pride  
Everywhere she goes, only love would know  
In the days gone by I came to believe  
Everything is trust, all the rest is dust  
Mother nature, mother dear, listen to us over here  
Are the sounds of laughter ringing true?  
Only love would know, only love would do  
She lives on another plane away from the drivin' rain  
She says no, you say yes  
And that's how it should be I guess  
Only love would know  
May the light of love surround you tonight  
Everywhere you go, only love would know  
You think, you were wrong until  
You learned once and for all it's still  
One more lesson on the way  
Or that is what it seemed to say  
She's not the kind who would soon step down  
Not the kind you would try to walk around  
When only a thought would go very well  
You can tell by the touch  
Ah but only love would know  
Passion burnin' bright  
Tears of passion late at night  
Is the light of passion burning bright?  
Everywhere you go, only love would know  

","Does the light of passion still burn bright?  
Only love would know my imagination  
Tells me I'm a pent-up fool in the deep end of the pool  
Is the light of passion burnin' tonight?  
Only love would know, only love would know

Gordon Lightfoot,Ordinary Man,"Try to understand

It's not your ordinary pride that keeps drivin' me on  
It's that lonesome, restless feelin' that you feel under the gun

I get so lonesome knowin' you could be around  
And when the show is over, there's a holiday motel  
Another empty bottle and another tale to tell  
  
Try to comprehend  
I'm not your ordinary friend at the end of my life  
I would pray that I could be  
Returning to the shelter of your love

Gordon Lightfoot,Peaceful Waters,"The dead leaves of autumn  
That cling so desperately  
Must fly before the cold October winds  
Their simple lives have ended  
Must they be born to die again  
  
Oh may the light of freedom shine  
For all the world to see  
And peace and joy to all mankind  
Through all the years to be  
  
For soon the leaves will die  
And the long hard wind will blow  
May this world find a resting place  
Where the peaceful waters flow

Gordon Lightfoot,Pride Of Man,"Turn around go back down go back the way you came  
Can't you see the flash of fire ten times brighter than the day  
And behold the mighty city broken in the dust again  
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again  
  
Turn around go back down go back the way you came  
Babylon is laid to waste Egypt's buried in her shame  
Their mighty men are beaten down the kings are fallen in the ways  
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again  
  
Turn around go back down go back the way you came  
Terror is on everyside though the leaders are dismayed  
Those who put their faith in fire in fire their faith shall be repaid  
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again  
  
Turn around go back down go back the way you came  
Shout a warning to the nations that the sword of god is raised  
On Babylon that mighty city rich in treasure wide in fame  
It shall cause thy towers to fall and make it be a pyre of flame  
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again  
  
Thou that dwell on many water rich in treasure wide in fame  
Bow unto a god of gold thy pride of might shall be thy shame  
Oh God the pride of man broken in the dust again  
  
And only God can lead the people back into the faith again  
Thy holy mountain be restored thy mercy on thy people Lord

Gordon Lightfoot,Protocol,"Who are these ones who would lead us now?  
To the sound of a thousand guns  
Who'd storm the gates of hell itself?  
To the tune of a single drum  
  
Where are the girls of the neighborhood bars?  
Whose loves were lost at sea?  
In the hills of France and on German soil  
From Saigon to Wounded Knee  
  
Who come from long lines of soldiers?  
Whose duty was fulfilled?  
In the words of a warrior's will  
And protocol  
  
Where are the boys in their coats of blue?  
Who flew when their eyes were blind?  
Was God in town for the Roman games?  
Was he there when the deals were signed?  
  
Who are the kings in their coats of mail?  
Who road by the cross to die  
Did they all go down into worthiness?  
Is it wrong for a king to cry?  
And who are these ones who would have us now  
Whose presence in concealed  
Whose nature is revealed  
In a time bomb  
  
Last of all you old sea dogs  
Who travel after whale  
You'd storm the gates of hell itself  
For the taste of a mermaid's tail  
Who come from long lines of skippers  
Whose duty was fulfilled?  
In the words of a warrior's will  
And protocol

Gordon Lightfoot,Race Among The Ruins,"You think you had the last laugh  
Now you know this can't be true  
Even though the sun shines down upon you now  
Sometimes you must feel blue  
You make the best of each new day  
You try not to be sad  
Even though the sky falls down upon you  
Call it midnight, feelin' bad  
  
[Chorus: ]  
When you wake up to the promise  
Of your dream world comin' true  
With one less friend to call on  
Was it someone that I knew  
Away you will go sailin'  
In a race among the ruins  
If you plan to face tomorrow  
Do it soon  
  
The road to love is littered  
By the bones of other ones  
Who by the magic of the moment  
Were mysteriously undone  
You try to understand it  
But you never seem to find  
Any kind of freedom comin' clean  
Is just another state of mind  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
So take the best of all that's left  
You know this cannot last  
Even though your mother was you maker  
From her apron strings you pass  
Just think about the fool  
Who by his virtue can be found  
In a most unusual situation  
Playin' jester to the clown

Gordon Lightfoot,Restless,"There's a kind of a restless feeling and it pulls me from within  
It sets my senses reeling and my wheels begin to spin  
In the quietude of winter you can hear the wild geese cry  
And I will always love that sound until the day I die  
There's a plain and a simple answer to each and every quest  
From every quiet dance who might be a special guest  
In a movie made for TV or a late night interview  
You might even find them on the Young and the Restless too  
Do ya get that restless feelin' when you hear a whistle blast  
Like an echo from the past  
Of an old engine flyin' down a road that's iron cast  
The lake is blue, the sky is gray, the leaves have turned to gold  
The wild goose will be on her way, the weather's much too cold  
When the muskie and the old trout too have all gone down to rest  
We will be returning to the things that we love best  
Do ya get that restless yearning when you think about your dad  
And the scrimshaw that he had  
Of an old schooner rovin' 'neath a sky that's ironclad  
There's a kind of a restless feeling and it catches you off guard  
As we gaze off at the distance through the trees in my back yard  
I can feel that restless yearning of those geese as off they roam  
Then trade that for a warm bed and a place I can call home  
Will ya get that restless yearning when you hear the wicked blast  
Of a specter from the past  
Of a cold diesel rollin' down a road that's built to last  
Still I get that restless feelin' when I hear a whistle blast  
See an image from the past  
Of an old schooner flyin' down a sky that's overcast

","There's a kind of a restless feeling and it pulls me from within  
It sets my senses reeling and my wheels begin to spin  
In the quietude of winter you can hear the wild geese cry  
And I will always love that sound until the day I die  
There's a plain and a simple answer to each and every quest  
From every quiet dance who might be a special guest  
In a movie made for TV or a late night interview  
You might even find them on the Young and the Restless too  
Do ya get that restless feelin' when you hear a whistle blast  
Like an echo from the past  
Of an old engine flyin' down a road that's iron cast  
The lake is blue, the sky is gray, the leaves have turned to gold  
The wild goose will be on her way, the weather's much too cold  
When the muskie and the old trout too have all gone down to rest  
We will be returning to the things that we love best  
Do ya get that restless yearning when you think about your dad  
And the scrimshaw that he had  
Of an old schooner rovin' 'neath a sky that's ironclad  
There's a kind of a restless feeling and it catches you off guard  
As we gaze off at the distance through the trees in my back yard  
I can feel that restless yearning of those geese as off they roam  
Then trade that for a warm bed and a place I can call home  
Will ya get that restless yearning when you hear the wicked blast  
Of a specter from the past  
Of a cold diesel rollin' down a road that's built to last  
Still I get that restless feelin' when I hear a whistle blast  
See an image from the past  
Of an old schooner flyin' down a sky that's overcast"

Gordon Lightfoot,Romance,"You said you were through with romance  
Why take a chance on anyone  
You're so beautiful too  
I can tell by the way that you dance  
They say that people don't change  
Why rear range the original  
You do something to me  
That my eyes cannot see at a glance  
Signs of a new beginning  
Signs of a life worth living  
The better to forget than to be all that upset  
It's the time to taste the wine  
And maybe someday things will change  
And come with in range and be laughable  
Everything is okay  
I can tell by the way that you dance  
They say that people don't try  
That's just a lie, they work miracles  
It's a gift from above  
When we talk about love and romance  
Signs of a new tomorrow  
Signs of a life without sorrow  
The better to forget than to be all that upset  
It's the time to taste the wine  
And maybe this time you will be

Sitting alone, my friends have all gone home  
You never know when they'll come droppin' in  
Thinking of girls with their fingers in my curls  
Too young to understand how love begins

Let me hold you for awhile?

There's a shadow on the moon  
And the waters here below  
Do not shine the way they should

Where that river runs away  
From the mountains in the spring time  
On a blue and windy day  
Where there's beauty all around  
As the shades of night grow deep  
When the morning stars grow dim  
They will find us in the shadows fast asleep

Gordon Lightfoot,She's Not The Same,"Ah, the living ain't easy  
With all of these false emotions  
Too little devotion and I'm tired of just  
Being alone, she's not the same  
She's a son of a gun, she's a red hot flame  
She lights the sun and conjures up the rain  
  
Like any good gambler  
I was chained to a wishing well  
I keep wishing in vain, but listen friend  
Don't look now, she's right behind you  
Looking for someone to take her inside  
It thrills her so, it's a rainbow ride  
  
I'm a little uneasy  
And there ain't much pride inside me  
She don't know how it hurts and I'm telling you  
It's too late now, she's not the same  
She's a red hot kid, she's a crying shame  
  
Anytime is the right time  
To get on with a new tomorrow  
But I could never let yesterday go  
And when the falling rain makes me sad  
She comes to me in the dreams I've had  
In the morning light, in the dead of night

I let it get the best of me  
She don't know how it hurts and I'm telling you

Gordon Lightfoot,Something Very Special,"She was something very special to me  
The kind of girl you'd like to see  
In a movie or a rosary  
  
She could be straight-laced or homespun  
Or free and easy on the run  
She could be meek and mild or full of fun  
  
She liked country lanes and aeroplanes  
And cigarettes would make her strange  
And when she wanted you she made it plain  
  
She would never say where she came from  
It didn't seem that she had anyone  
To answer to or dwell upon  
  
She liked candlelight and good wine  
And I would call her any time  
Of day or night she didn't mind  
  
The was nothing that I wouldn't do  
To prove to her my love was true  
And she gave to me a dream or two  
  
There were times when she would never appear  
For days and then she'd disappear  
But now the days have turned to years  
  
I was something she could use  
Like a good friend or a pair of shoes  
Or any kind of good news  
  
Now the eastern sky is crimson and red  
As I lie here in my lonely bed  
And think about the things she said  
  
She said darling there will come a day  
When I must run far away  
I will go my love and you must stay  
  
She departed in the early spring  
She didn't leave me anything  
To follow or to find her  
  
She was something very special to me

To answer to or dwell upon  
  
She liked candlelight and good wine  
And I would call her any time  
Of day or night she didn't mind  
  
The was nothing that I wouldn't do  
To prove to her my love was true  
And she gave to me a dream or two  
  
There were times when she would never appear  
For days and then she'd disappear  
But now the days have turned to years  
  
I was something she could use  
Like a good friend or a pair of shoes  
Or any kind of good news  
  
Now the eastern sky is crimson and red  
As I lie here in my lonely bed  
And think about the things she said  
  
She said darling there will come a day  
When I must run far away  
I will go my love and you must stay  
  
She departed in the early spring  
She didn't leave me anything  
To follow or to find her  
  
She was something very special to me  
The kind of girl you'd like to see  
In a movie or a rosary"
Gordon Lightfoot,Sometimes I Wish,"Dreaming of a love I lost, the day the final bridge was crossed  
Sometimes I wish that I could just forget  
But the memory lingers yet and it hangs around  
Leaving me low and leaving me down  
Everywhere I roam, there is nobody home  
Even I should know, when it ain't my day there is no other way  
I begin to wake up, how wrong it was to cling to you  
Sometimes I wish to hold you in my heart  
'Cause I can't keep us apart, forgiving you  
Was the easiest thing that I ever could do  
Everywhere I go, there is no one I know  
Even I can see, it's too late now to believe in a vow  
As I wander I return, to days gone by there's much to be learned  
Sometimes I wish that miracles could be  
But at best I fail to see any happening  
Some gotta lose and some gotta win  
Everywhere I roam, there is nobody home  
Even I should know, when it ain't my day there is no other way  
Everywhere I go, there is no one I know  
Even I can see, it's too late now to believe in a vow  
You're leaving right now

Gordon Lightfoot,Somewhere U.S.A.,"Out on the road like a low-down Joe  
And the bar where we are is so cool I'd like to stay  
Misunderstood like I knew I would be  
The one I care for don't mind, she's built that way  
I would gladly offer you my love  
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A.  
  
This rental car never went so far  
But with each passing mile on more dream has turned to clay  
Now that we've met and your eyes are all wet  
Let me fetch my guitar, there's a song I'd like to play  
I would gladly offer you my song  
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A.  
  
One never knows where the good times  
If you got some to spend,we'll do anything you say  
I'd never lie, well you know I've tried  
Though you think it's the drink that has made me behave this way  
I would gladly offer you my love  
In this hotel in Somewhere U.S.A

Gordon Lightfoot,Stay Loose,"If you've got a heartache  
Of the kind that will not pass by  
Even if you don't see the end  
Of what lies around the bend  
Don't stay that way  
It's all in a day believe me  
Even the best of dreams must end  
Even so it grieves me  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let it take you all the way and  
If it's wrong, you will right it  
Do not waste these hours away  
How many times have I told you  
These are the tears I've shed  
Could it be that I need help  
Is it maybe I've come undone  
And one thing more  
You know it don't come easy  
Even the best of friends must part  
Even so it grieves me  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let love take a holiday  
If it's wrong, you're gonna right it  
Do not waste these hours away  
Soon the storm will be over  
And the clouds will all pass by  
To be insane beyond belief  
Is sometimes the best relief  
And one thing sure  
Love never did come easy  
Even the best of dreams must end  
Even so it grieves me  
Stay loose, don't fight it  
Let it take you all the way and  
If it's wrong, you will right it

Gordon Lightfoot,Steel Rail Blues,"Well I got my mail late last night  
A letter from a girl who found the time to write  
To her lonesome boy somewheres in the night  
She sent me a railroad ticket too  
To take me to her lovin' arms  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well I bin out here many a long days  
I haven't found a place that I could call my own  
Not a two bit bed to lay my body on  
I bin stood up I bin shook down  
I bin dragged into the sand  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Ooooh oooo oo whee hee hee  
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo  
  
Well I bin up tight most every night  
Walkin' along the streets of this old town  
Not a friend to tell my troubles to  
My good old car she done broke down  
'Cause I drove it into the ground  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Well I look over yonder across the plain  
The big drive wheels are poundin' along the ground  
Gonna get on board and I'll be homeward bound  
Now I ain't had a home cooked meal  
And Lord I need one now  
And the big steel rail  
Gonna carry me home to the one I love  
  
Ooooh oooo oo whee hee hee  
Ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo ooo oo  
  
Now here I am with my head in the sand  
Standin' on the broad highway would you give a ride  
To a lonesome boy who missed the train last night  
I went in town for one last round  
And I gambled my ticket away  
And the big steel rail  
Won't carry me home to the one I love

Gordon Lightfoot,Stone Cold Sober,"If you really knew how many times I've tried to help you  
Make your mind up in the matters of the heart, you'd not be bothered  
By the miscues or the bad trips that seem to come and plague us  
Having thought it over, I sure would like to talk to you again  
  
I was stone cold sober, it was daylight in October  
When you reached across the table put your hand upon my shoulder  
And my lips were warm with kissing while we found the missing pieces  
To all the empty spaces I sure would like to talk that way again  
  
We have soared above the clouds, we've heard the angels breathing  
While we made love in the morning, there was never talk of leaving  
We would lie that way for hours with our arms around each other  
It was all so easy, I sure would like to talk to you again  
  
'Cause I'm stone cold sober, the daylight has crossed over  
In the night, a touch of sadness  
We had it coming, had it going way back then  
  
I was stone cold sober when I woke the morning after  
Having shattered the illusions of the object of my passions  
With a will made out of iron and a mind that is her own  
Having thought it over, I sure would like to talk to her again  
We had it coming, had it going way back then  
  
I hope that we can see each other often  
That our points of view will blend into each other,  
Like the sea and the horizon  
And the sun will shine upon us as we live our lives forever  
Having thought it over, I sure would like to talk to you again

Gordon Lightfoot,Summertime Dream,"Where the road runs down but the butternut grove  
To old Bill Skinner's stream  
Do tell at the noonday bell  
It's time for a summertime dream  
In a lunch pail town in a one horse way  
You can live like a king and queen  
Let's steal away in the noonday sun  
It's time for a summertime dream  
  
Birds in all creation will be twitterin' in the trees  
And down below's a pond I know  
You can swim in it if you please  
And if you come 'round when the mill shuts down  
You can see what chivalry means  
Let's steal away in the noonday sun  
It's time for a summertime dream  
  
On a trip on down to wonderland  
In love among the flowers  
Where time gets lost with no straw boss  
Tallyin' up the hours  
Where the road runs down by the butternut grove  
To old Bill Skinner's stream  
Do tell at the noonday bell  
It's time for a summertime dream

Gordon Lightfoot,Thank You For The Promises,"Thank you for the promises we make  
I know I can't complain  
I think I did all right  
No failures are in sight  
Only now and then  
I'd like to reminisce  
Do you remember when  
  
Even if we're angels we can't ask  
To wander through the past  
The future is our goal  
The night is black as coal  
If I could pay the price  
I'd like to love you once  
I'd love to love you twice  
  
Thanks  
We cannot say enough  
The road is sometimes rough  
But we can get along  
The going will get tough  
But we won't be afraid  
Of the promises we made  
  
Thank you for the promises you keep  
When I am fast asleep  
To be where we belong  
Is all that I can ask  
We can do it in the shade  
As long as I have you  
And the promises we made  
  
Thank you for the promises we break  
If you made a clean mistake  
Well that's what love's about  
No need to stand and shout  
The truth is in your eyes  
The answer lies within  
No need to criticize  
  
Thanks  
For the promises at hand  
The abuse that we must stand  
Is often heaven sent  
They may not pay the rent  
You never can be sure  
When promises get bent  
  
Thank you for the promises that live  
This is all that I can give  
Forever in my mind  
To leave the past behind  
And seal it with a kiss  
Forever in my soul  
I will remember this

Gordon Lightfoot,That Same Old Obsession,"I come to this garden, I come here to rest  
Early each day upon rising  
I think of my lost love from over the sea  
And sometimes I've wondered, if she thinks of me  
I long to recall every kiss, every kind word  
I miss her so much I could die  
But the creatures of evil have captured her heart  
And that same old obsession still keeps us apart  
There's peace in the garden, there's peace in the air  
Peace in the sound of the river  
There's peace in the meadow, the sun shines like gold  
And if she were with me there'd be peace in my soul  
I long to return to the place I remember  
The taste of her lips close to mine  
I could do much better if I could be strong  
Come into my garden but leave me alone  
I come to this garden, I come here to rest  
Just as the night comes stealing  
Someone is weeping, I'm calling her name  
Deep in the garden, deep in my brain  
I long to recall every kiss, every kind word  
I miss her so much I could die  
But the creatures of evil have captured her heart  
And that same old obsession still keeps us apart

To the night and the empty skies  
  
The first time ever I kissed your mouth  
I felt the earth turn in my hand  
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird  
That was there at my command my love  
That was there at my command  
  
The first time ever I lay with you  
And felt your heart beat close to mine  
I thought our joy would fill the earth  
And would last 'till the end of time my love  
And would last 'till the end of time  
  
The first time ever I saw your face  
I thought the sun rose in your eyes  
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave  
To the night and the empty skies my love

Gordon Lightfoot,The Gypsy,"Step inside my tent, said she, ""I'd like to read you palm""  
Leave the dollar in the jar, this won't take very long  
Leave the circus noise behind, close your eyes, relax your mind  
I'll tell you, if you should quit now or if you should go on  
Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
Where'll I go, what'll I be?  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
She threw some sawdust in the air and her hands began to shake  
She told me, the town where I was born, she almost knew the date  
She lit a candle with her eyes and then she made the table rise  
She took the dollar from the jar and then she guessed my weight  
Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
You are so old, you are so wise  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dy  
Give me a sign, tell it to me  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
Then she spoke most quietly  
Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee  
When you we a child at school they taught you quite a lot  
You were told when you should speak and when you should not  
You were taught to read and write, to take your lessons home at night  
A little knowledge serves you well but the golden rule does not  
Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
Where'll I go, what'll I be?  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""  
Then when I came home that night to lie in bed awake  
I thought of that old gypsy and the words that she had said  
And now I see with due respect, the more we learn the worse we get  
So if you feel you've no regrets, go have your fortune read  
Then I said, ""Now what do ya see?""  
She said, ""Deedlee-dumb, deedlee-dee""

Till I was wrapped in the arms of a Mississippi man  
When he holds me close it feels almost  
Like another hurricane just ripped the coast  
If he can't come to me, I'm gonna go to him  
That Mississippi River Lord, I'm gonna swim  
  
Hey Louisiana woman, Mississippi man  
We get together every time we can  
The Mississippi River can keep us apart  
There's too much love in this Mississippi heart  
Too much love in this Louisiana heart  
  
Well Mississippi River Lord it's one mile wide  
And I'm gonna get me to the other side  
Mississippi man, I'm losin' my mind  
Gotta have your loving one more time  
I'm gonna jump in the river and here go  
Too bad alligator you swim too slow

See the alligators all a waitin' nearby  
Soon or later they know I'm gonna try  
When she wave from the bank don't you know I know  
It's goodbye fishin' line see you while ago  
With a Louisiana woman waitin' on the other side  
The Mississippi River don't look so wide

Loretta Lynn,Love Is The Foundation,"I've seen him as he awakens in the morning  
He reaches out his hand and without a word  
As his fingers softly fall upon my face  
He lights the flame of desire and makes me want him.  
  
Chorus:  
Love is the foundation we lean on and all you need is love to ease your mind.  
It doesn't have to be right to be called love  
When he gives me more lovin' that a lifetime of looking could ever find.  
(repeat)

Loretta Lynn,Rose Garden,"I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden  
Along with the sunshine there's gotta be a little rain sometimes  
When you take you gotta give so live and let live or let go  
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden  
I could promise you things like big diamond rings  
But you don't find roses growing on stalks of clover so you'd better think it
over  
When it's sweet talking you could make it come true  
I would give you the world right now on a silver platter but what would it
matter  
So smile for a while and let's be jolly love shouldn't be so melancholy  
Come along and share the good times while we can  
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden  
  
I could sing you a tune and promise you the moon  
But if that's what it takes to hold you I'd just as soon let you go  
But there's one thing I want you to know  
You better look before you leap still water runs deep  
And there won't always be someone there to pull you out  
And you know what I'm talking about  
So smile for a while and let's be jolly  
I beg you pardon I never promised you a rose garden

Loretta Lynn,Ruby Madge And Mable,"Sometimes true love has to choose to do what it don't want to do  
And sometimes patience has to give up a hanging on  
Darling I'll be far away and you'll be wishing I had stayed  
After Ruby Madge And Mable send you home  
After Ruby settled down and Madge moved back to her hometown  
After Mable says you're fool leave me alone  
You'll find out how much it hurts and just how much a dream is worth  
After Ruby Madge And Mable send you home  
[ piano ]  
You'll find out what lonely mean but you won't find the broken chain  
That once bound our love together proud and strong  
You start talking to the walls and count every tear that falls  
After Ruby Madge And Mable send you home  
After Ruby settled down...

Loretta Lynn,Saint To A Sinner,"You put a halo and wings around me now you say that I have gone bad  
But while you were busy with business and booze  
I lost the wings and the halo I had  
You say I went from a saint to a sinner but you can't blame me for it all  
You were the teacher I was just a beginner you don't know how it hurt me to
fall

Loretta Lynn,Satin Sheets,"Satin sheets to lie on satin pillows to cry on  
But still I'm not happy don't you see  
Big long Cadillacs pretty clothes upon my back  
But still I want you to set you free  
I found another man who can give me more than you can

Loretta Lynn,Secret Love,"Once I had a secret love that lived within the heart of me  
All too soon my secret love became impatient to be free  
So I told a friendly star the way that dreamers often do  
Just how wonderful you are and why I'm so in love with you  
Now I shout it from the highest hills even told the golden daffodils  
And now my heart's an open door and my secret love's no secret anymore  
Now I shout it from the highest hills
