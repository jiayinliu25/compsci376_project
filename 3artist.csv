raisin' they kids and your daddy want it very right i make you happy plus i'm jewish he don't approve i think he want you to marry white he want sinatra at the wedding not barry white cause black is black honey even if he's very light and so i never been for dinner at they places always brutally honest and so i pin it to they faces i live it so the case is whether drake is way ahead of his time

you give any insight for what it must have been like for someone like lebron to make that decision and that ultimate responsibility  drake  yeah i mean i think that for the last week and a half ive probably been bothering lebron as much as the press has trying to figure out what his decision is going to be i think we were all extremely intrigued by what stage of his life hes in i dont think that theres a better way to deal with it than how he just did i think if we can give out an award at the espys for incredible essay writing i would definitely love to present that to him because i think what he just did was patriotic in its own way was courageous and was just to me i think its going to be one of the most historic things of our generation  im just honored to know him and glad that ive gotten to no pun intended witness this moment for sure i think its an incredible thing  i actually woke up kind of late today so im just catching on its a great feeling for me i cant wait to get off this call and call him myself and tell him how proud i am because hes been a friend of mine for a long time  shell  obviously youve joined saturday night live and weve had justin timberlake host the show are you going to take a more musical approach to the espys than what weve seen in the past  drake  i think obviously one of the talents that im able to bring to the espys is music but im just going to get up there and i want to just prepare a great night for people i think we have prepared an incredible night for people i definitely want to incorporate music but im not there to put on a strictly musicbased show yeah we definitely have some incredible pretapes yeah i think its just going to be a great night overall im there to deliver a great hosting job  shell  what makes the perfect espys host weve seen some amazing people like justin timberlake and john hamm and even lebron james what strikes the perfect balance between a sports fan and an entertainer  drake  well i think what makes a perfect espys host is obviously somebody that can fill the room with energy and joy for the people that are in the seats but i think most importantly what i bring is the fact that i feel that i know the room better than any host before me just because so many of these guys i have personal relationships with i think im going to be able to tap into some jokes that will be appreciated by my friends in the crowd and also the athletes that i dont know  to me its just about knowing the room that youre in and trying to have the right presence and trying to give these guys an incredible night which they deserve  shell  hosting a sports awards show what do you feel is musics role in sports  drake  well i said once in a rap song that deep down we want to be them and they want to be us as far as musicians and athletes go i think that when i speak to any of my friends that play sports theyre always super into music whether it be rap or other genres my dream in life or my other dream in life that ill obviously never achieve was to go to college and be recruited and play in the league so i think theyre synonymous in that way we inspire each other and i think thats what really ties music and sports together  shell  this is a question for the producer and if possible i have a followup for drake with the lebron news and the decision that was so successful for espn was there an actual attempt to get his announcement slated for the espys did anybody reach out were you close  maura mandt  no there was not an attempt to have that be there and with the decision it wasnt something we were looking to have that announcement be on the espys certainly if lebron wanted to announce on the espys i would have happily had him there i think what the espys is about is the sports world plays out over the year and then we find the right person to help put that into perspective and thats what you look for the host for  were going to be reflecting on the year and lebron is something that happened so it will definitely be something that well address in the show but just like in sports we dont try to make that news happen it unfolds  shell  drake in monologues hosts usually take jabs at those in attendance and a lot of times in hiphop thats kind of also a part of rap music and its always been do you see similarities to delivering jokes on stage whether it be metaphorically or outright in hiphop  drake  i think thats a funny question i think its a good fit i definitely think that hiphop is a little more malicious than what any host is going for i think were not trying to end peoples careers or make people feel bad in any way and thats kind of most of the time what problems in hiphop are about so our night like i said is about being funny and about giving these guys a great time and celebrating sports  so yeah i think there is definitely a difference though being clever with words is being clever with words so that is one advantage that any musician has or any great writer has but i think the end goals are a bit different  shell  youre also being aware of public perception for instance you instagrammed the meme of yourself playing soccer right and you so like you definitely have i dont know how to put it maybe a love triangle thing going on with skylar and shell probably be there can we expect a joke or where youll mention it like you did with snl when you did the whole dated rihanna thing everyone loved it so can we expect that now that youll be hosting the espys  drake  well i obviously dont want to give away the material but i do have a growing affection for skylar and im not sure shell be able to make it but im sure ill give you a treat if you enjoy my past references im sure if i havent done it already now that i know youre looking for it i might stick one in there for sure you never know  shell  one of the things about espn and the espys is the incredible amount of social media reaction there is during the shows and the buildup  today i dont know if you realize this but youve been the talk of social media because of the pictures that chris brown posted up i just wonder about your feelings on that and if you can tell us what that means  drake  well as far as the latter end of the question id rather not comment on it but i know that our goal is obviously the night of the espys to completely take over the internet for everything that we do to go viral and for people to enjoy days or weeks afterwards i think that is kind of the goal of anything in this day and age is to sort of have a life on the internet thats why im excited  weve been working hard like i said on the pretapes and on the monologue and on every aspect of the show just to make sure that it lives on past this night which i can 00 guarantee it will  shell  is cleveland your new favorite sports city how are you going to incorporate a wiggins manziel and lb james into your espy segment  drake  first of all id like to say that despite what everyone on the internet thinks i do not team jump ive been  in the past ive always supported the player and not the institution unless its the kentucky wildcats or the toronto raptors those are two teams that i will never stray from but what people have to understand whether it comes to soccer whether it comes to football or obviously basketball i have a lot of friends that play for a lot of different teams  so its not that im team jumping im just a supportive friend with the recent news of course im going to go  of course im going to go watch games in cleveland if not for lebron who like i said has been a brother to me for years i mean weve got three kids from toronto on one team plus we have manziel who again is part of our family and like a brother  so i definitely have to look into some real estate in cleveland and maybe make some trips this year i might have to go spend a month out of the year there and watch my guys do what they do best  but yeah like i said my teams will always forever be who they are but yes i will support the group that has shifted to cleveland i think that for cleveland a place that ive been time and time again touring i just think its going to be greet i really would love to see that city grow because theyre just a supportive group of people and it is a great place so im really excited  shell  so the espys is your second host gig this year snl was amazing by the way so is hosting something that youre trying to do more of or are you just working on more music you have a lot to write about now that youre a bachelor again  drake  well actually my status hasnt changed just to clear that up ive always been out here coasting but aside from that the espys is my main focus like snl when i commit to something i dont let my focus stray  so for maura to give me this opportunity to host i dont take it lightly i put everything on hold to be  to give the best performance that i possibly can at this awards show and then from there i have things coming up whether its the ovo fest or the tour with lil wayne which is a real thing which a lot of people dont know if its a real thing or not but its very real and its going to be very competitive and then from there ill figure out the next steps for me  im always working on new music but the espys is the main focus right now and well figure out whats next afterwards  shell  one thing we learned about you after hosting snl is youre a tremendous impressionist i personally loved the katt williams and lil wayne  with having so many friends and being friendly with people in the audience can we expect you to break out any impressions during the show   drake  yeah im actually excited to say that i definitely have incorporated impressions in my performance and that is something that i actually pride in that i studied for i love finding a character and getting into that character especially if i know the person or know their mannerisms or can really study their mannerisms so yes i will be doing impressions during the espys and theyre good im excited  theyre great  shell  are you bringing your lint roller  drake  oh yes i think ill probably have it somewhere around maybe i should i should bring it out on stage you shouldnt have said it on the call you should have anonymously sent that tip in maybe we would have used the joke no i think ill be lintfree that night ill have a stylist and hopefully there is no lint on any of my suit  shell  so we know that you wore some custom calvin klein outfits for your tour are you planning on the same fashion wearing any calvin klein suits and which stars are you in terms of sports world are you looking forward to what theyre going to wear  drake  im not exactly sure what brands im going to be wearing right now im sort of still like i said very focused on the show ill figure out the suit aspect probably next week and what particular designers ill be wearing but im more excited about the costumes and the sort of athlete outfits that ill be draped in for you all to admire so thats really what my main focus is but ill get my suits together im also excited to see what the athletes are wearing through the show because that can make for a joke in itself i might just cut to somebody and i wont have to say anything  shell  you have so many relationships with a lot of athletes is there anyone in particular that you havent met yet that youre looking forward to meeting or have any of your friends that youre with already given you any advice about hosting  drake  well i mean ive gotten a lot of well wishes from my friends you know one of my mentors who is not an athlete but obviously jamie foxx a previous host and a big reason why i asked to be a part of this just because that performance that he gave i believe he hosted twice or three times oh twice right it was inspiring to me for so many reasons because of how he incorporated music but how funny he was and how commanding his presence was so his mentorship and advice has been great to me is there anybody that im looking forward to meeting i mean yeah i was going to say ive never met skylar im sure it will be extremely awkward when i do but i guess that would be my answer if she manages to show up which she probably wont her boyfriend will probably tie her down to a chair or something but yeah if i ever get to meet her i probably owe her an apology right off the bat its been all in good spirits but yeah that is the one person id like to meet  just for that last person i also want to meet this guy that says that he lost because he listened to my music i want to meet that guy and just look him in the eye and see exactly who he is as a man and size him up and then chop him right down yeah nick whatever his name is because he didnt win so thats how hes going to be remembered nick whatever his name is  shell  can you talk a little bit about the collaborative process in preparing for the awards and how many of the ideas are coming from you and how many are coming from the writing staff also if you think writing a joke is harder than writing a song  drake  oh very good double question well for the first part the collaborative process has been absolutely incredible we have such a great team from obviously the chief boss lady maura all the way down to the writers and everybody thats involved everyone involved has been incredible to work with weve been at it now for three months i think just on and off meeting and talking and brain storming as far as ideas being mine i am very happy and proud to say that a lot of the ideas that i submitted are what im going to be performing or delivering on wednesday night whether it be music jokes and pretaped pieces i was heavily involved in the input of what to deliver and how to deliver it  is writing a joke harder than writing a song i think that because of the way i write songs which is very honest raw emotion about my life i think that writing a joke becomes a little easier for me because its just a little more lighthearted than your average brooding drake song as the public would deem it  but yeah i mean all my music is so honest that sometimes its hard to tap into that and be that honest with yourself when youre able to be lighthearted and joke around i enjoy it it comes a little quicker than songs do  mandt  id like to make a comment on the collaboration process having worked on the show a number of years one of the things that really resonates in the content is when its authentic from the person delivering it being able to have the access weve had to drake from the first time we met and spoke and had his input on whats coming up with stuff that he wants to do and us being able to go back and contribute and have them come to life it really elevates it so its definitely been a collaborative process on his end and being involved  we had a shoot the other day from one of the skits and on set he was coming up with stuff and you guys will see it and know what im talking about when you see the show but there was no script in certain areas of it it was really like an improv session and it was one of the greatest things to be able to see im really excited to have that be seen

so over the years a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end how long does it take where do you write what are the circumstances do you start with music do you start with lyrics and my answer is always that it happens differently every time and that's why i'm still so in love with song writing so what i've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started different ways so i'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how i put songs together  i sent this voice memo to ryan tedder because i'd always wanted to work with him and finally we scheduled some studio time so i always wanna be prepared i wanted to send him the idea that i was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said i can't stand that i wanna work on something else think of something else so i just sat down with the piano put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where i wanted to go with the song how i saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called i know places so this was the voice memo i sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song  okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing  uhuhuhoh ohohohi ohohoh ohohohi ohohohoh ohohohiii  na na na na waiting at the back door they're around and the vultures come around and you know that they won't they won't us say what they want 'bout say what they want 'bout us and you come and sing and listen i would not think about it but i'm not done every know that a thing or two about it thing or two about it i  cause they got the cages they got the boxes and guns they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run  baby i know some places we won't be found and they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down cause i i know places we can hide i know places i know places  uhuhuhi uhuhuhi ohohi uhuhuhi know places  or whatever i don't know but that's basically just like a dark really dark lyric like  thing and it's about like everybody's like trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever and it's like you just whatever you know and the  would just go to that major and just be like ooh  so i hope you like it it wouldn't be a piano thing it would be like vocalizing like very like beat now i'm just making weird sounds hope you like it,Taylor Swift,year lot people ask sort describe song writing process begin end long write circumstance start music start lyric answer happen differently time love song write show different example beginning stage song start different way explain maybe help understand kind song   send voice memo ryan tedder want work finally schedule studio time wanna prepare want send idea work go studio case write say stand wanna work think sit piano phone piano kind explain want song see melody sit end record song day end record call know place voice memo send night end finish song   okay kind rough idea thing   uhuhuhoh ohohohi ohohoh ohohohi ohohohoh ohohohiii   na na na na wait door vulture come know will will want 'bout want 'bout come sing listen think know thing thing   cause get cage get box gun hunter fox run   baby know place will find chase tail try track cause know place hide know place know place   uhuhuhi uhuhuhi ohohi uhuhuhi know place   know basically like dark dark lyric like   thing like everybody like try ruin love like know   major like ooh   hope like piano thing like vocalize like like beat make weird sound hope like

spoken writing the song lover was one of those magical experiences that you sometimes get to have as a songwriter um i wrote it really quick in the middle of the night as soon as i wrote it i knew i wanted it to be the album title and i knew that writing it kinda would depict the tone of the entire record so it was a real catalyst for what this album turned into and i wrote it alone so i wanted to go in and play it for jack antonoff who i knew who would be the perfect person to produce it and so i walked into the studio and i sat in the piano and this is what happened  so it is it's basically i don't see it as a piano i think it's that like kinda of dreamy y throwback but not like camp throwback so   sung we could leave the christmas lights up 'til january this is our place we make the rules and there's a dazzling haze a mysterious way about you dear have i known you 0 seconds or 0 years  can i go where you go can we always be this close forever and ever and ah take me out take me home you're my my my my lover  spoken yeah i love the walk down i love the walk down i was trying to figure out what the hell is gonna happen there so the so  sung my my my my lover  we could let our friends crash on the couches this is our place we make the call and i'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you i've loved you three summers now honey but i want 'em all  can i go where you go can we always be this close forever and ever and ah take me out and take me home you're my my my my lover  spoken okay and then i have this  thing that's um essentially well no i was i did i did it in this key but it could be this thing like a key change  so it plays off of the walk downish but it's this is the melody of it it goes it's like  sung ladies and gentlemen will you please stand with every  string scar on my hands i take this magnetic force oh fuck i take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover my heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue all's well that ends well to end up with you swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me  spoken wait so goes like  sung and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me and at every table i'll save you a seat  spoken so goes and you it goes  sung and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me my heart's been borrowed your heart's been blue all's well that ends well to end up with you swear to be overdramatic swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover and you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me and at every table i'll save you a seat  spoken you like yeah i've never i never do these cords but i was really at the piano like hashing it out yesterday,Taylor Swift,spoken write song lover magical experience     songwriter um   write quick   middle night soon write know want album title know write kinda depict tone entire record real catalyst album turn write want play jack antonoff know perfect person produce walk studio sit piano happen   basically piano think like kinda dreamy y throwback like camp throwback    sing leave christmas light til january place rule dazzling haze mysterious way dear know second year   close forever ah home lover   speak yeah love walk love walk try figure hell go to happen   sing lover   let friend crash couch place highly suspicious see want love summer honey want them   close forever ah home lover   speak okay   thing um essentially key thing like key change   play walk downish melody go like   sing lady gentleman stand   string scar hand magnetic force oh fuck magnetic force man lover heart borrow blue end end swear overdramatic true lover save dirty joke   spoken wait go like   sing save dirty joke table save seat   speak go go   sing save dirty joke heart borrow heart blue end end swear overdramatic swear overdramatic true lover save dirty joke table save seat   speak like yeah cord piano like hash yesterday
jameela jamil presents swift with her award  absolutely love this one right this is sort of a it's not a short speech so just i don't want this to slip and break 'cause it's very important to me  jamil takes the award from swift to hold  thank you so much she's so supportive we all need someone like that i'm taylor good evening i wanna first thank billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor for   microphone stand lowers  whoa this is going great so far excellent okay i wanna say thank you so much to billboard for giving me this honor for naming me as their woman of the decade so what does it mean to be the woman of this decade well it means i've seen a lot when this decade began i was 0 years old and i had put out my selftitled debut album when i was 6 and then the album that would become my breakthrough album which was called fearless and i saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that i was really curious about i saw pop stations send my songs love story and you belong with me to number one for the first time  and i saw that as a female in this industry some people will always have slight reservations about you whether you deserve to be there whether your male producer or cowriter is the reason for your success or whether it was a savvy record label it wasn't i saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry and i saw something in me change due to this realization this was the decade when i became a mirror for my detractors whatever they decided i couldn't do is exactly what i did  audience claps  huh i'll take it thanks whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems and the best lyrical examples i can think of are songs like mean shake it off and blank space basically if people had something to say about me i usually said something back in my own way and this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics when fearless did win album of the year at the grammys and i did become the youngest  artist to ever win the award with that win came criticism and backlash in 00 that i'd never experienced before as a young new artist all of a sudden people had doubts about my singing voice was it strong enough was i a little bit pitchy all of a sudden they weren't sure if i was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past i had had cowriters in the room  at that time i couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard i believe a popular headline back then was a swift backlash which is clever you gotta give it to them and now i realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond people's comfort level i now have come to expect that with good news comes some sort of pushback but i didn't know that then  so then i decided that i would be the only songwriter on my third album speak now and that i would tour constantly work on my vocals every day and perfect my stamina in a live show i decided i would be what they said i couldn't be i didn't know then that soon enough people would decide on something else i wasn't quite doing right and then the circle would keep going on and on and rolling along and i would keep accommodating overcorrecting in an effort to appease my critics  they're saying i'm dating too much in my twenties okay i'll stop i'll just be single for years now they're saying my album red is filled with too many breakup songs okay i'll make one about moving to new york and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends oh they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music alright okay here's an entire genre shift and a pop album called 989  audience cheers  oh you heard it sick now it's that i'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends okay i can stop doing that too now i'm actually a calculated manipulator rather than a smart businesswoman okay i'll disappear from public view for years now i'm being cast as a villain to you okay here's an album called reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere  in the last ten years i have watched as women in this industry are criticized and measured up to each other and picked at for their bodies their romantic lives their fashion or have you ever heard someone say about a male artist i really like his songs but i don't know what it is there's just something about him i don't like no that criticism is reserved for us but you know i've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this who lets that scrutiny break them and who just keeps making art i've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade lana del rey was ruthly criticized   someone in the audience cheers  yes yeah thank you we have similar tastes i like it she was ruthlessly criticized in her early career and then slowly but surely she turned into in my opinion the most influential artist in pop her vocal stylings her lyrics her aesthetics they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner in music and this year her incredible album is nominated for album of the year at the grammys because she just kept making art and that example should inspire all of us that the only way forward is forward motion that we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us  and i see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry whose work i absolutely love i see it in lizzo rosalía tayla parx hayley kiyoko king princess camila cabello halsey megan thee stallion princess nokia nina nesbitt sigrid normani her maggie rogers becky g dua lipa ella mai billie eilish and so many other amazing women who are making music right now  female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth streaming record and ticket sales and critical acclaim so why are we doing so well because we have to grow fast we have to work this hard we have to prove that we deserve this and we have to top our last achievements women in music onstage or behind the scenes are not allowed to coast we are held at a higher sometimes impossiblefeeling standard and it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge and they have accepted it it seems like the pressure that could've crushed us made us into diamonds instead and what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger but we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios behind the mixing board in ar meetings because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room  audience cheers  we now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade and that is the streaming world in music we're always walking handinhand with technology and sometimes that is so awesome like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday i've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes i still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up and i hope that in the next decade we can keep searching for the right solution for producers songwriters and creators don't you  audience claps  lately there's been a new shift that has affected me personally and that i feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry and as your resident loud person i feel the need to bring it up and that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in and buying up our music as if it is real estate as if it's an app or a shoe line this just happened to me without my approval consultation or consent after i was denied the chance to purchase my music outright my entire catalogue was sold to scooter braun's ithaca holdings in a deal that i'm told was funded by the soros family  capital and the carlyle group  yet to this day none of these investors have ever bothered to contact me or my team directly to perform their due diligence on their investment on their investment in me to ask how i might feel about the new owner of my art the music i wrote the videos i created photos of me my handwriting my album designs and of course scooter never contacted me or my team to discuss it prior to the sale or even when it was announced  i'm fairly certain he knew how i would feel about it though and let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying but he's always been nice to me when i'm raising valid concerns about artists and their right to own their music and of course he's nice to you if you're in this room you have something he needs the fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think according to his own social media post that he could buy me but i'm obviously not going willingly  yet the most amazing thing was to discover that it would be the women in our industry who would have my back and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times and i will never ever forget it like ever  audience laughs  but to conclude i will say that in ten years i've seen forward steps in our industry in our awareness our inclusion our ability to start calling out unfairness and misconduct i've seen the advent of social media the way it can boost the breakthrough of emerging artists and i've seen fans become more engaged and supportive than ever before i've leaned on that support and it has kept me in a place where no matter what i always wanted to keep making music for them  i was up on a stage in new york city in 04 accepting billboard woman of the year and i was talking about the future of streaming how we needed to make sure that the female artists writers and producers of the next generation were protected and compensated fairly this was before my record deal with universal last year that would contractually guarantee that the artists on their roster be paid upon any sale of their spotify shares unrecupable so thank you for that  audience cheers  this speech i'm referring to was on my 5th birthday i'm about to turn thirty tonight woo but my exact quote during this speech was i really just feel like we need to continue to try to offer something to a younger generation of musicians because somewhere right now your future woman of the year is probably sitting in a piano lesson or in a girls' choir and today right now we need to take care of her i've since learned that at that exact moment an year old girl in california really was taking piano lessons and really was in a girls' choir and this year she has been named woman of the year at the age of seventeen her name is billie  audience cheers  and those are the stories we need to think about every day as we do our jobs in this industry the ones where people's dreams come true and they get to create music and play it for people the ones where fans feel a connection to music that makes their day easier makes their night more fun makes their love feel more sacred or their heartache feel less isolating the ones where all of you in this room stand as an example for someone else in the next generation who loves the same thing that we love music and no matter what else enters the conversation we will bring it back to music  and as for me lately i've been focusing less on doing what they say i can't do and more on doing whatever the hell i want thank you for a magnificent happy free confused sometimes lonely but mostly golden decade i'm honored to be here tonight i feel very lucky to be with you thank you so much,Taylor Swift,jameela jamil present swift award   absolutely love right sort short speech

my favorite kinds of books to read are the ones that do more than just tell you a story they do more than just set the scene or paint the picture the writing i love the most places you into that story that room that rain soaked kiss you can smell the air hear the sounds and feel your heart race as the character's does its something f scott fitzgerald did so well to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment  i'm highly biased but i think that the way music can transport you back to a longforgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time to this day when i hear cowboy take me away by the dixie chicks i instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in pennsylvania i'm clutching a  and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house when i hear i write sins not tragedies by panic at the disco im transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of hendersonville tennessee with my best friend abigail euphorically screaming the lyrics when i hear how to save a life by the fray breathe am by anna nalick or the story by brandi carlile i immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end when i'd get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew i would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room  just being alone with those songs those are all from the grey's anatomy soundtrack my commitment to that show truly knows no bounds i'm convinced that you learn by alanis morissette put your records on by corinne bailey rae and why by annie lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs   i love writing songs because i love preserving memories like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had i like to use nostalgia as inspiration when i'm writing songs for the same reason i like to take photographs i like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times i want to remember the color of the sweater the temperature of the air the creak of the floorboards the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever  the fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of i thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being well universal you'd think that as pop writers we're supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to so you'd assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic and yet the ones i think cut through the most are actually the most detailed and i dont mean in a shakespearean sonnet type of way although i love shakespeare as much as the next girl obviously see love story 009  in modern pop songsbopschunes including extremely personal details like kiki do you love me and baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover have been breaking through on the most global cultural level this year on tour i got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from cuba singing about havana  i think these days people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to we like being confided in and hearing someone say this is what i went through as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles we actually do not want our pop music to be generic i think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive this glimpse into the artists story invites us to connect it to our own and in the best case scenario allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories it's this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal or made us cry dance or escape that truly stands the test of time just like a great book,Taylor Swift,favorite kind book read one tell

according to my birth certificate i turn 0 this year it's weird because part of me still feels 8 and part of me feels 8 but the actual age i currently am is 9 i've heard people say that your thirties are the most fun so i'll definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when i know but until then i thought i'd share some lessons i've learned before reaching 0 because it's 09 and sharing is caring  lesson   i learned to block some of the noise social media can be great but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you arent how youre failing or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment one thing i do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments yes i keep comments off on my posts that way im showing my friends and fans updates on my life but im training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that i look  im also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to go die in a hole ho while im having my coffee at nine in the morning i think its healthy for your selfesteem to need less internet praise to appease it especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist an actual comment i received once  lesson   being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble while it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady this can contribute to some of your lifes worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you grow a backbone trust your gut and know when to strike back be like a snakeonly bite if someone steps on you  lesson   trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal it may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture you had to give me one moment of bitterness come on but that said its good to mess up and learn from it and take risks its especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching thats good well always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace no this is not an excuse to text your ex right now thats not what i said or do it whatever maybe youll learn from it then youll probably forget what you learned and do it again but its fine do you youre searching  lesson 4  i learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body i worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves shinier hair and more energy i think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting but taking it too far can be really dangerous there is no quick fix i work on accepting my body every day  lesson 5  banish the drama you only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it be discerning if someone in your life is hurting you draining you or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable blocking their number isnt cruel its just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it  lesson 6  ive learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us these messages tell women that we arent allowed to age its an impossible standard to meet and ive been loving how outspoken jameela jamil has been on this subject reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women were supposed to defy gravity time and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isnt even remotely required of men  lesson 7  my biggest fear after the manchester arena bombing and the vegas concert shooting i was completely terrified to go on tour this time because i didnt know how we were going to keep  million fans safe over seven months there was a tremendous amount of planning expense and effort put into keeping my fans safe my fear of violence has continued into my personal life i carry quikclot army grade bandage dressing which is for gunshot or stab wounds websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address ive ever had online you get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things every day i try to remind myself of the good in the world the love ive witnessed and the faith i have in humanity we have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears  lesson 8  i learned not to let outside opinions establish the value i place on my own life choices for too long the projected opinions of strangers affected how i viewed my relationships whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me or what they thought was couples goals based on a picture i posted on instagram that stuff isnt real for an approval seeker like me it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my own value system of what i actually want  lesson 9  i learned how to make some easy cocktails like pimms cups aperol spritzes oldfashioneds and mojitos because06  lesson 0  ive always cooked a lot but i found three recipes i know ill be making at dinner parties for life ina gartens real meatballs and spaghetti i just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground beef for meat nigella lawsons mughlai chicken and jamie olivers chicken fajitas with molé sauce getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer i also learned how to immediately calculate celsius to fahrenheit in my head which is what im pretty sure the internet would call a weird flex  lesson   recently i discovered command tape and i definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if id hung things that way all along this is not an ad i just really love command tape  lesson   apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you even if it was unintentional its so easy to just apologize and move on try not to say im sorry but and make excuses for yourself learn how to make a sincere apology and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships  lesson   its my opinion that in cases of sexual assault i believe the victim coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through i know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing awful experience i believe victims because i know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying this happened to me its something no one would choose for themselves we speak up because we have to and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we dont  lesson 4  when tragedy strikes someone you know in a way youve never dealt with before its okay to say that you dont know what to say sometimes just saying youre so sorry is all someone wants to hear its okay to not have any helpful advice to give them you dont have all the answers however its not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour your support is all someone needs when theyre at their lowest point even if you cant really help the situation its nice for them to know that you would if you could  lesson 5  vitamins make me feel so much better i take ltheanine which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety i also take magnesium for muscle health and energy  lesson 6  before you jump in headfirst maybe i dont knowget to know someone all that glitters isnt gold and first impressions actually arent everything its impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room but what i know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them i call it a solid first 5 but the layers of a person you discover in time are they honest selfaware and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it do they show up for you when you need them do they still love you after theyve seen you broken or after theyve walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if theyre people these are things a first impression could never convey  lesson 7  after my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a sharpie as eyeliner do not do it i felt like i needed to start being nicer to my skin i now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after i shower not just in the winter but all year round because why cant i be soft during all the seasons  lesson 8  realizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them for example never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me even as an adult i still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at in my twenties i found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend so i shouted it from the rooftops posted pictures and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood without realizing that other people might still feel the way i did when i felt so alone its important to address our longstanding issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them  lesson 9  playing mind games is for the chase in a real relationship or friendship youre shooting yourself in the foot if you dont tell the other person how you feel and what could be done to fix it no one is a mind reader if someone really loves you they want you to verbalize how you feel this is real life not chess  lesson 0  learning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships something about were in our young twenties hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family and maybe they will be for the rest of your life or maybe theyll just be your comrades for an important phase but not forever its sad but sometimes when you grow you outgrow relationships you may leave behind friendships along the way but youll always keep the memories  lesson   fashion is all about playful experimentation if you dont look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe youre doing it wrong see bleachella  lesson   how to fight fair with the ones you love chances are youre not trying to hurt the person you love and they arent trying to hurt you if you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from theres a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who won the fight i know a couple who in the thick of a fight say hey same team find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built they dont give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship they just give out divorce papers  lesson   i learned that i have friends and fans in my life who dont care if im canceled they were there in the worst times and theyre here now the fans and their care for me my wellbeing and my music were the ones who pulled me through the most emotional part of the reputation stadium tour for me was knowing i was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up ill never forget the ones who stuck around  lesson 4  ive had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family both of my parents have had cancer and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again its taught me that there are real problems and then theres everything else my moms cancer is a real problem i used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs i give all of my worry stress and prayers to real problems now  lesson 5  i remember people asking me what are you gonna write about if you ever get happy theres a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art that art and suffering go hand in hand im really grateful to have learned this isnt true finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool  lesson 6  i make countdowns for things im excited about when ive gone through dark low times ive always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app theyre free and adding things im looking forward to even if theyre not big holidays or anything its good to look toward the future sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now and its good to get some perspective that life will always go on to better things  lesson 7  i learned that disarming someones petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh in my experience ive come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously a few years ago someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet the fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than ive ever felt in my life but i cant tell you how hard i had to keep from laughing every time my 6foot inflatable cobra named karyn appeared onstage in front of 60000 screaming fans its the stadium tour equivalent of responding to a trolls hateful instagram comment with lol it would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us but maybe all ill ever get is the satisfaction of knowing i could survive it and thrive in spite of it  lesson 8  im finding my voice in terms of politics i took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our daytoday life i saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk and felt like i had to speak up to try and help make a change only as someone approaching 0 did i feel informed enough to speak about it to my 4 million followers invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what i want from our leaders and i realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric im going to do more to help we have a big race coming up next year  lesson 9  i learned that your hair can completely change texture from birth i had the curliest hair and now it is straight its the straight hair i wished for every day in junior high but just as i was coming to terms with loving my curls theyve left me please pray for their safe return  lesson 0  my mom always tells me that when i was a little kid she never had to punish me for misbehaving because i would punish myself even worse id lock myself in my room and couldnt forgive myself as a fiveyearold i realized that i do the same thing now when i feel ive made a mistake whether its selfimposed exile or silencing myself and isolating ive come to a realization that i need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice trusting the wrong person or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone step into the daylight and let it go,Taylor Swift,accord birth certificate turn year weird feel feel actual age currently hear people thirty fun definitely post finding

i see music it's more than justwhat i hear when i'm connected to something i immediately see a visual or a series of images that are tied to a feeling or emotion a memory from my childhood thoughts about life my dreams or my fantasies and they're all connected to the music and i think that's one of the reasons why i wanted to do a visual album i wanted people to hear the songs with the story that's in my head cause it's what makes it mine that vision in my brain is what i want people to experience the first time    i feel like right now people experience music differently i remember seeing thriller on tv with my family it was an event we all sat around the tv and now looking back i'm so lucky i was born around that time i miss thatimmersive experience now people only listen to a few seconds of a song on their ipods  they don't really invest in a full album it's all about the single and the hype there's so much that gets between the music and the artist and the fans i felt like 'i don't want anybody to give the message when my record is comnig out i just want this to come out when it's ready and from me to my fans' i told my team 'i wanna shoot a video for every song and put them all out at the same time' everyone thought i was crazy but we're actually doing it it's happening    i wanted to make this body of work and i feel like it's something that's lost in pop music i wanted people to hear things differently and have a different first impression not just listen to a ten second clip but see the whole vision of the album it was important that we made this a movie we made this an experience i wanted everyone to see the whole picture and to see how personal everything is to me i would make my best art and just put it out and that'sthat's why it's out today,Beyonce,music justwhat hear connect immediately visual series image tie feeling emotion memory childhood thought life dream fantasy connected music think reason want visual album want people hear song story head cause make vision brain want people experience time     feel like right people experience music differently remember see thriller tv family event sit tv look lucky bear time miss thatimmersive experience people listen second song ipod   invest album single hype get music artist fan feel like want anybody message record comnig want come ready fan tell team wanna shoot video song time think crazy actually happen     want body work feel like lose pop music want people hear thing differently different impression listen clip vision album important movie experience want picture personal good art that'sthat today

narration beyoncé  i sometimes wish i could just be anonymous and walk down the street just like everyone else before i was famous i was the girl on the heel with the  i was the girl who just wanted a beautiful view of the beach and now that i'm famous it's really really difficult to do very simple things i think it's the hardest thing to give up but my mother always taught me to be strong and to never be a victim never make excuses never expect anyone else to provide for me things i know i can provide for myself i have dreams and i feel like i have a power to actually make those dreams a reality when you're famous no one looks at you as a human anymore you become the property of the public there's nothing real about it  just look at these dazzling women the finest representatives of our nation ready to reach for the stars and grab the crown  you can't put your finger on who i am i can't put my finger on who i am i am complicated i grew up with a lot of conflict and drama's and i've been through a lot just like everyone else my escape was always music and i'm so lucky that that's my job but if i accomplished all of these things and had no one to share with it would be worth nothing you know you need something real in order for any of this stuff to matter you have to have something that is forever something that's invisible  i was brought up seeing my mother try to please and make everyone comfortable and i always felt like it was my job to fix the problem people pleaser but i'm no longer afraid of conflict and i don't think conflict is a bad thing because i know that when you grow up when you learn a few things  you're no longer afraid of letting go you're no longer afraid of the unknown you're no longer afraid of going to certain places in your body and your mind and your soul that may make you feel uncomfortable and it all starts with if you could look at yourself in the mirror and say i like that person you know if i hadn't gone through you know some of the painful experiences in my life i would not be me and i feel like my body is borrowed and this life is very temporary i watched my friends body deteriorate and to see some one pass on so gracefully put everything into perspective we do not value ourselves enough especially young people don't really appreciate how brilliant our bodies are i've always been very very specific and very choosy very choosy about what i do with my body and who i want to share that with people feel like they lose something when they get married but it doesn't have to be that way there's nothing more exciting than having a witness to your life i always considered myself a feminist although i was always afraid of that word because people put so much on it when honestly it's very simple it's just when you know a person that believes in equality for men and women men and women balance each other out and we have to get to a point where we are comfortable with appreciating each other i have a lot of empathy for men and the pressures that they go through and the cultures that have been created especially for africanamerican men i have the same empathy for women and the pressures we go through the woman has to provide so many things for their children i consider myself a humanist  you know everybody's not good at everything you know it's ok to depend on someone it's actually what we're supposed to do we're supposed to depend on each other and when you find the person that you trust and you love and you feel is going to respect you and take all of the shit you have and turn it around and bring out the best in you and feed you it is the most powerful thing you can feel in your life happiness comes from you no one else can make you happy you make you happy and one thing that's for sure the love i have for music for my husband for my child is something that will last far beyond my life,Beyonce,narration beyoncé   wish anonymous walk street like famous girl heel   girl want beautiful view beach

there's a moment where things click when i was in the studio i was threading the songs together and ithought of this performance which was a really defining moment in my life as a child in my mind we would perform on star search we would win we would get a record deal and that was my dream at the time there's no way in the world i would ever imagine losing as a possbility you know i was only 9 years old so at that time you don't realise that you could actually work super hard and give everything you have and lose it was the best message for me when i put ed macmahon ducing us as the hiphop rapping girls' tyme it clicked something in my mind i feel like something about the aggression of bow down and the attitude of flawless  the reality is sometimes you lose and you're never too good to lose you're never too big to lose you're never too smart to lose it happens and it happens when it needs to happen and you have to embrace those things    i was scrolling through videos about feminism on youtube and i ran across this video of this incredible nigerian author chimamanda ngozi adichie everything she said is exactly how i feel  my message behind this album is finding the beauty in imperfection i had this image of this trophy and me accepting these awards and kind of training myself to be this champion and at the end of the day when you go through all of these things is it worth it i mean you get this trophy and you're like 'i basically starved i have neglected all of the people that i love i've conformed to what everybody else thinks i should be and i have this trophy what does that mean' the trophy represents all of the sacrafices i made as a kid all of the time that i lost being on the road in the studios as a child and i just wanna throw that shit up i have a lot of awards and i have a lot of these things that i'm amazing and i'm  i worked my ass of i worked harder then probably everybody i know to get those things but nothing feels like my child saying 'mommy' no nothing feels like when i look at my husband in the eyes nothing feels like when i'm respected when i get on the stage and i see i'm changing people's lives those are the things that matter and at this point in my life that's what i'm striving for growth love happiness fun enjoying your life it's short  that's the message,Beyonce,moment thing click studio thread song ithought performance define moment life child mind perform star search win record deal dream time way world imagine lose possbility know year old time realise actually work super hard lose good message ed macmahon duce hiphop rap girl tyme click mind feel like aggression bow attitude flawless   reality lose good lose big lose smart lose happen happen need happen embrace thing     scroll video feminism youtube run video incredible nigerian author chimamanda ngozi adichie say exactly feel   message album find beauty imperfection image trophy accept award kind train champion end day thing worth mean trophy like basically starve neglect people love conform everybody think trophy mean trophy represent sacrafice kid time lose road studio child wanna throw shit lot award lot thing amazing   work ass work hard probably everybody know thing feel like child say mommy feel like look husband eye feel like respect stage change people life thing matter point life strive growth love happiness fun enjoy life short   message
